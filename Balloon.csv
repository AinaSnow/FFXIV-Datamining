in the pot, I could boil
my boot and I reckon it'd
taste fine enough."

Probably good and sour
by now!"

And who are you again?"

those cast-off skins?
Name your price!"

3811,False,"Understood!"
3812,False,"A marid eats as much
in a day as five chocobos
do in a sennight."
3813,False,"They say the best salt's
that what's been harvested
by hand...er, rake."
3814,False,"They seem to be doing
just fine without my help."

take ninety-five."
3817,False,"If I find you've been cutting
Master Lolorito's salt with
chalk again..."
3818,False,"Never! You have my word!"
3819,False,"There's plenty of salt to
sell...but no one to buy it."
3820,False,"These blocks are not
going to move themselves."
3821,False,"You've two, don't you?"
3822,False,"I could use another hand."
3823,False,"If it helps Ala Mhigo,
I'll rake from dawn till dusk!"
3824,False,"They say there is none
finer than Saltery salt,
and the Bismarck must
have the finest!"

chocobos. I don't fancy
carrying a sack of salt all
the way back to Gridania..."

I don't know which
to sample first!"

working, it's a matter of
expanding operations..."

work for them all..."

we know what to do with!"
3836,False,"We didn't see nothing if
you didn't see nothing."
3837,False,"But we have done nothing
wrong! Nothing!"
3838,False,"You're looking better today!"
3839,False,"No thanks to you and
your nosiness."
3840,False,"Ishibushi! Help! I know you
can hear me! Ishibushi!"
3841,False,"I can take over, if you like..."
3842,False,"Aye, aye, that's the way..."
3843,False,"Area past the gate's not safe."
3844,False,"It's not a bad idea, but..."
3845,False,"Must you be forever ringing...
that infernal bell..."
3846,False,"So I says to the maiko, I says..."

3851,False,"Not now! I'm busy!"
3852,False,"Da says he's gonna throw all
your toys in the One River if
you don't come right now!"
3853,False,"I'm not falling for that again!"
3854,False,"Fine! See what happens!"
3855,False,"Leave the materials here?"
3856,False,"Aye, right there's fine!"
3857,False,"I can't wait to see what it
looks like when it's finished!"
3858,False,"Wonder what they're
going to do with it..."
3859,False,"Where do you want these?"
3860,False,"Give me a moment!"
3861,False,"Where did I leave
that ledger...?"
3862,False,"(Don't...don't mind
me over here... Ugh...)"
3863,False,"Then what would you like
us to purchase instead?"
3864,False,"That ought to suffice for now."
3865,False,"Looks like we've still
got plenty of spices."
3866,False,"Very good, very good..."
3867,False,"Hmm... Thought we had more
around here somewhere..."
3868,False,"I don't think we've got enough
vegetables to last the week."
3869,False,"Let Kozakura know.
She'll take care of it."
3870,False,"Everything is accounted for.
I triple-checked."
3871,False,"Including the materials
for Master Tsuranuki?"
3872,False,"...Perhaps I should check again."
3873,False,"Perhaps you should."
3874,False,"I come bearing gifts!"
3875,False,"Any luck?"
3876,False,"I've got a good feeling..."
3877,False,"Something took the bait!"
3878,False,"Oho!"
3879,False,"A marvelous catch!"
3880,False,"Let's see what else is biting!"
3881,False,"Reeled it in too quickly...?"
3882,False,"Don't give up so easily!"
3883,False,"...Is this upside down?"
3884,False,"Need anything?"
3885,False,"Might could do with
a few more boards!"
3886,False,"I'll see what I can do."
3887,False,"Smiths need more boards─"
3888,False,"It's time to go!"
3889,False,"Can't we stay another night?"
3890,False,"No! We didn't come
all the way here to
laze about!"
3891,False,"But we might never
be able to sleep on
such comfy beds again!"
3892,False,"I'll blame you if
someone else claims those
marks before we do!"
3893,False,"One more night!
That's all I ask!"
3894,False,"Kweh!"
3895,False,"We're spreading
ourselves too thin..."
3896,False,"Tell me, does this hurt?"
3897,False,"Ah! Only when you
poke it like that!"
3898,False,"That means you're
on the mend."
3899,False,"Be more careful in future.
You're no good to us dead."
3900,False,"Argh! My stomach!"
3901,False,"You shouldn't eat
wild berries. They
could be poisonous!"
3902,False,"Do it again, and I'll
cut you open and
dig them out myself!"
3903,False,"I could while away the hours,
Liftin' bags of salt and flour,
If I only had a crane.♪"
3904,False,"Winching her up, then!
Stand clear!"
3905,False,"The buckets are full!"
3906,False,"A manfool!
A manfool in our midst!"
3907,False,"I hate manfools!"
3908,False,"The manfool is still about..."
3909,False,"Gah! What a stalker!"

through the change!"
3912,False,"Heh, pretty rare for a rat
to live long enough─"

I am an otter, good sir!"
3914,False,"That's it! I'm going to
go and see the sacred
crystal right this instant!"
3915,False,"Don't do it! Genbu's gonna
put a curse on you!"
3916,False,"Hah! You can't scare me!"
3917,False,"None shall pass!"
3918,False,"Just this once! Please!"
3919,False,"Set one hoof inside and
Genbu will curse you for
ten thousand years!"
3920,False,"Fine! But you haven't
heard the last of this!"
3921,False,"They wouldn't let me pass..."
3922,False,"Of course not!
They didn't before,
so why would they now!?"
3923,False,"It's been a while since
I said hello..."
3924,False,"I am of a mind to hunt.
Interested?"
3925,False,"Such serenity, such peace..."
3926,False,"Though my body aches..."
3927,False,"I no longer fear for my soul.
My thanks to you..."
3928,False,"Hehe, you're funny!"
3929,False,"Do you have any more medicine?"
3930,False,"It's getting harder to come by.
You'll have to pay double."
3931,False,"Didn't think you'd come back,
given your condition..."
3932,False,"...Was curious, is all."
3933,False,"Never hurts to have an extra set of eyes looking over the hull!"
3934,False,"Need to get this
tub patched up..."
3935,False,"Look at you, boy.
Life on the sea has
made you strong..."
3936,False,"Mother, I...
I never thought
I'd see you again."

4313,False,"Seven hells!
Get a bloody room, will ye!?"
4314,False,"The next match is mine!"
4315,False,"Mewling cub!
You'll never defeat me!"
4316,False,"I'll show ye how to swing a damn hammer!"
4317,False,"The abyss take me..."
4318,False,"Wh-Which tile should I discard...?"
4319,False,"Well, this is a disaster!"
4320,False,"And one is meant to scale this edifice...?"
4321,False,"Ulalaaa!"
4322,False,"I love you!"
4323,False,"Mashaaa!"
4324,False,"Yes!"
4325,False,"U-lah-lah!"
4326,False,"Hah! Hah!"
4327,False,"Narumiii!"
4328,False,"She looked at me!"
4329,False,"W-We're safe...?"
4330,False,"The sky..."
4331,False,"What's happening...?"
4332,False,"Lord...Vauthry..."
4333,False,"Long may...you reign..."
4334,False,"Ohhh..."
4335,False,"Hallowed be his name..."
4336,False,"Blessed is the meol..."
4337,False,"Is this supposed to be part of the show?"
4338,False,"Something's happening..."
4339,False,"Did you summon those things!?"
4340,False,"What in the gods' name is that!?"
4341,False,"That way! The crown's that way!"
4342,False,"Keep running! You're almost there!"
4343,False,"Phew, we did it..."
4344,False,"Time to collect our prize."
4345,False,"I daresay they've had their fill of sport."
4346,False,"Is... Is it over?"
4347,False,"Their mastery over glamours is truly astounding."
4348,False,"It was no less than what
I expected, but─well done."
4349,False,"Alisaie..."
4350,False,"Rest well..."
4351,False,"A Lightwarden, gone.
I can scarce believe it."
4352,False,"Good. Keep that
memory with you."
4353,False,"That Lightwarden...
That was <Emphasis>terrifying</Emphasis>."
4354,False,"And thus doth the night return."
4355,False,"So the Warden of the wood falls."
4356,False,"We've taken back the darkness!"
4357,False,"At last."
4358,False,"It seems that Ryne was correct."
4359,False,"Thank goodness we succeeded."
4360,False,"That was a passing
strange form for an eater."
4361,False,"Are you at all injured?"
4362,False,"Vauthry awaits."
4363,False,"It's the moment of truth."
4364,False,"No eaters remain to
stand in our way."
4365,False,"I feel it above─
a powerful light."
4366,False,"All has gone to plan thus far.
...To the extent there <Emphasis>is</Emphasis> a plan."
4367,False,"An eater that only makes
the others fiercer. Lovely."
4368,False,"We shall not falter!"
4369,False,"Not for despair, nor fate itself."
4370,False,"Be on your guard.
This is wholly his realm."
4371,False,"<Emphasis>Where</Emphasis> is Emet-Selch?"
4372,False,"This is it─the
first and final end."
4373,False,"The unwinding of life itself..."
4374,False,"One cannot help but pity Vauthry..."
4375,False,"Finally, all the Lightwardens are gone..."
4376,False,"Come out, come out, wherever you are!"
4377,False,"What should we do when we find them?"
4378,False,"We send them flying! Tee hee!"
4379,False,"Aaany moment now..."
4380,False,"D-Don't let them eat me!"
4381,False,"What in the world...?"
4382,False,"What's wrong with everyone? "
4383,False,"Where...where am I?"
4384,False,"Ungh... My head..."
4385,False,"Long live...Lord Vauthry?"
4386,False,"It was awful... <sob>"
4387,False,"Are you all right?"
4388,False,"Zzzzzz..."
4389,False,"<snore> <snore>"
4390,False,"<slurp> <snort>"
4391,False,"Wake up, damn you!"
4392,False,"What's happening!?"
4393,False,"It's the dust! Don't breathe in the dust!"
4394,False,"Keep an eye on them buggers!"
4395,False,"We're gonna need more meat..."
4396,False,"Who's a pretty girl, then?"
4397,False,"I think...<hic>...I've had enough..."
4398,False,"Whisk, whisk until it's mixed!♪"
4399,False,"Grab a seat!
...And a mug!"
4400,False,"You do too much..."
4401,False,"Ugh, I need a drink..."
4402,False,"Aye, that hits the spot!"
4403,False,"Lali-hooo!"
4404,False,"La... La...li...ho!"
4405,False,"Hup! Ha!"
4406,False,"No swivin' Goggs about, then?"
4407,False,"B-Blast! It's higher than I thought..."
4408,False,"No rips that I can see..."
4409,False,"Heading in for a pint?"
4410,False,"We've got to protect our food stores!"
4411,False,"Is there aught else you need?"
4412,False,"I'm fine for now, thanks."
4413,False,"Just a few more rows!"
4414,False,"Hey! We're meant to do our chores first!"
4415,False,"Wait!"
4416,False,"I'm gonna get you!"
4417,False,"Yay! I got you!"
4418,False,"Nuh-uh! I let you catch me!"
4419,False,"That's enough! You're <Emphasis>both</Emphasis> winners."
4420,False,"Let's play catch-the-kitten!"
4421,False,"All right, you go first!"
4422,False,"This way, slowpoke!"
4423,False,"Almost time to eat!"
4424,False,"W-We'll get you some medicine..."
4425,False,"It's gotta be cooked by now..."
4426,False,"Did you hear what happened to that girl!?"
4427,False,"That ought to keep the wind out."
4428,False,"Please...
Whatever you can spare..."
4429,False,"Maybe I should join him..."
4430,False,"But the letter from the Crystarium said..."
4431,False,"I hope this crop turns out better than the last..."
4432,False,"Don't you wag your finger at me!"
4433,False,"I once knew twins who had hair just like yours!"
4434,False,"We'd best scout the area first."
4435,False,"You can cross that bridge when you come to it."
4436,False,"The forest calls to me..."
4437,False,"I am not lying! I saw it!"
4438,False,"Well, if the others don't get here soon, we'll have to eat their share!"
4439,False,"Give me a moment, would you? I'm sure it's crooked!"
4440,False,"That is what Uimet said, anyway."
4441,False,"It is probably true, in that case."
4442,False,"Is everything ready?"
4443,False,"Master Lanille has taken care of it."
4444,False,"Then I shall return to my post."
4445,False,"I'd better count them again, just to be sure."
4446,False,"Yes, yes! Adorable!"
4447,False,"There must be at least one shiny here!"
4448,False,"Not a bad price, all things considered."
4449,False,"I'll get us a good deal, don't you worry!"
4450,False,"Now, you stay right there!"
4451,False,"Hmm? Where did it go?"
4452,False,"I take my eyes off of it for one moment..."
4453,False,"Come back here!"
4454,False,"Not again!"
4455,False,"Not good, not good..."
4456,False,"There it is!"
4457,False,"You must not wander off like that, understood?"
4458,False,"That's a fair point..."
4459,False,"I have a feeling I've forgotten something."
4460,False,"Come now, you mustn't fret."
4461,False,"It never ceases to amaze.
Every time I see it..."
4462,False,"What am I supposed to do now!?"
4463,False,"A tasty morsel of information, yes?"
4464,False,"Leave no stone unturned..."
4465,False,"To see a sin eater from so close... I will never forget it."
4466,False,"And we'll split the profits!"
4467,False,"Yes, it's all here, as agreed."
4468,False,"So, ready to get back to work?"
4469,False,"Not yet. Still coughing up grey phlegm."
4470,False,"Erm... You might wanna get that looked at..."
4471,False,"The Fuath are nothing but trouble!"
4472,False,"As my master always used to say..."
4473,False,"Yes, better than boiling them, methinks."
4474,False,"A fair trade, it would seem."
4475,False,"A bit on the small side, perhaps..."
4476,False,"Slowly but surely do the mushrooms grow."
4477,False,"The blue one... Or the other blue one... Hmm..."
4478,False,"I am sure my eyesight is getting worse."
4479,False,"Oh! This is a heavy one!"
4480,False,"Gather round, little ones."
4481,False,"And we'll call it “Delta Attack!”"
4482,False,"Let's try shapechanging!"
4483,False,"That sounds like fun!"
4484,False,"Watch this!"
4485,False,"Ooh! I can't wait to see this!"
4486,False,"Piff, paff, poff!"
4487,False,"Eek!"
4488,False,"Oink!"
4489,False,"Hee hee! How terribly amusing!"
4490,False,"Haha! A porxie!"
4491,False,"Oink! Oink!"
4492,False,"Now I just need to work out how to reverse it..."
4493,False,"Wait for me!"
4494,False,"Come back!"
4495,False,"Ummm..."
4496,False,"It's a beaver!"
4497,False,"Snook!"
4498,False,"You'll never catch me!"
4499,False,"Snook! Chit!"
4500,False,"I wonder who pushed up <Emphasis>these</Emphasis> daisies?"
4501,False,"If I eat the whole thing, I shall go “pop!”"
4502,False,"All this frolicking has worn me out..."
4503,False,"Haven't you had enough!?"
4504,False,"Come on, lazy bones! There's frolicking to be done!"
4505,False,"So soft... So fluffy..."
4506,False,"No one can fly higher than meee～♪"
4507,False,"Now you see me, now you don't!"
4508,False,"Found me again! I'll have to try harder!"
4509,False,"Very good! Let's see if you can find me again!"
4510,False,"Ooh! You won't be so lucky next time!"
4511,False,"You're fun! Bye for now!"
4512,False,"Come now, don't sulk! Here, I brought you a flower!"
4513,False,"You're like a walking cloud!"
4514,False,"And they'll never suspect a thing!"
4515,False,"Hurry up and grow!"
4516,False,"Please, anything you can spare!"
4517,False,"That's what you get for pushing your luck!"
4518,False,"Nana nana nana nana, fishing!"
4519,False,"A steal at half the price!"
4520,False,"My fortune is just a few scoops of dirt away!"
4521,False,"As soon as his back's turned, that soup is mine!"
4522,False,"Next time, I'll set the line a bit lower."
4523,False,"Why must there be so many rules?"
4524,False,"I hope I haven't forgotten anything."
4525,False,"Why are they eating pebbles?"
4526,False,"Oh no! It looks like I've burnt it!"
4527,False,"He's gonna eat his face off! I can't wait!"
4528,False,"Go for the ribs! Don't let that bastard breathe!"
4529,False,"One good gust of wind, and the whole thing'll come down."
4530,False,"Maybe it's time to flip them over?"
4531,False,"Take that, you bastard nail! And that!"
4532,False,"This burgling lark's harder than I thought!"
4533,False,"If I stay drunk, I'll never get hungover!"
4534,False,"Stick to the plan, and we can't fail!"
4535,False,"Why must this take so long?"
4536,False,"They're sure to be impressed by my posing!"
4537,False,"Maybe I should draw the curtain..."
4538,False,"Be a good boy and fetch me some wine, would you?"
4539,False,"Yes, milady."
4540,False,"I had hoped there would be something in the Buttress to entertain me..."
4541,False,"...but it seems I was mistaken."
4542,False,"Back to the Understory it is."
4543,False,"Your wine, milady."
4544,False,"Tsk! That bloody fickle cow!"
4545,False,"""Where? Up your arse and 'round the corner!“ Ha!"
4546,False,"I wish they'd make these eyeholes a bit bigger."
4547,False,"Time for a stroll..."
4548,False,"...to the parlor!"
4549,False,"And then the wretched pauper split his head open! Hilarious!"
4550,False,"It's my money, and I'll spend it how I please!"
4551,False,"But, of courshe─hic!─the eldersh musht never know of thish!"
4552,False,"Oh, don't you worry about that, my friend!"
4553,False,"Haha! How very unlike you, Oboro!"
4554,False,"Hic! Perhapsh I have partaken a bit more than─hic─ushual..."
4555,False,"I tire of this place. Come."
4556,False,"Yes, my lady."
4557,False,"How frightfully vulgar!"
4558,False,"I quite agree."
4559,False,"Silence! When I want your opinion, I will ask for it!"
4560,False,"Yes, my lady!"
4561,False,"What I would not give for some stimulating conversation..."
4562,False,"One day, I shall buy this plaza and decorate in the manner of my choosing."
4563,False,"Yes, my lady..."
4564,False,"Care for a drink, sir?"
4565,False,"Can you not see I am busy!?"
4566,False,"I can't even give this stuff away..."
4567,False,"Why will no one take a drink?"
4568,False,"Maybe you should be more assertive?"
4569,False,"All right, I'll try."
4570,False,"Are you sure we haven't got anything better?"
4571,False,"Marry me, and you shall have everything you could wish for!"
4572,False,"It's about time I changed the string."
4573,False,"Oh my! How did you get so dusty?"
4574,False,"All right, you've made your point!"
4575,False,"I'd stick to the path if I were you."
4576,False,"But I'm ready for the front line!"
4577,False,"This ought to last us a while."
4578,False,"I'll work off this beer belly eventually!"
4579,False,"There'll be no trouble, I swear!"
4580,False,"There's something down there, I know it!"
4581,False,"Whoever built this thing must've been in a hurry."
4582,False,"Nothing to report!"
4583,False,"You'd better do one more circuit, just to be sure."
4584,False,"Yes, yes... I know how to do my job, thanks."
4585,False,"Soon, my pretty, soon..."
4586,False,"I could put one in that smug prick's back from up here. He wouldn't even know what hit him..."
4587,False,"And we even managed to get the best room they have!"
4588,False,"We should get away like this more often."
4589,False,"What could you have been doing to end up in such a state?"
4590,False,"Yes, but I hear enormous swords are all the rage!"
4591,False,"I want to see those noses touch the ground!"
4592,False,"If we pull this off, we'll make a killing!"
4593,False,"I swear my eyesight's getting worse..."
4594,False,"If I see you sleeping on the job again, you'll be on latrine duty until I say you've had enough!"
4595,False,"I have a feeling I'm in the wrong place..."
4596,False,"These feathers would fetch a gil or two..."
4597,False,"<pant> <pant>"
4598,False,"This is madness..."
4599,False,"Wh-What do we do...?"
4600,False,"Aaah!"
4601,False,"Shall we?"
4602,False,"Lead the way."
4603,False,"And here we have the Rotunda."
4604,False,"Watering, watering, all day long! "
4605,False,"All finished!"
4606,False,"Good work."
4607,False,"Here's the next batch."
4608,False,"So, I should scatter these in the same place."
4609,False,"That's right!"
4610,False,"And what comes after that?"
4611,False,"Yes, four apples, seven lemons. How many times must you count them!?"
4612,False,"My achin' bones..."
4613,False,"If I stare at those crates long enough, maybe they will move themselves."
4614,False,"Marvelous! Splendid!"
4615,False,"I fear this disagrees with my aesthetic sensibilities..."
4616,False,"This one might do..."
4617,False,"So? Find anything?"
4618,False,"I did indeed!"
4619,False,"And the reward is not bad either!"
4620,False,"Such vibrant colors!"
4621,False,"Where could it have gone?"
4622,False,"I'm sure it wouldn't sprout legs and walk off by itself."
4623,False,"Perhaps it found its way over here?"
4624,False,"Or perhaps not."
4625,False,"Maybe it's lurking in here?"
4626,False,"I do not see that posing any difficulties."
4627,False,"“By the time you read this, I shall surely be...”"
4628,False,"Well, perhaps if you'd brushed your hair away from your eyes, you'd have seen it!"
4629,False,"I should take another look, just in case."
4630,False,"But that would mean that cucumbers are fruit..."
4631,False,"We're still waiting for those new ladders to be delivered, I'm afraid."
4632,False,"“...and ripped out his still-beating heart...”"
4633,False,"I can never find what I'm looking for."
4634,False,"Something about needles and haystacks springs to mind..."
4635,False,"Would it kill them to organize things a bit better?"
4636,False,"Who needs ladders when you have magic!"
4637,False,"So, where is it?"
4638,False,"Erm..."
4639,False,"I didn't ask for an “erm,” did I?"
4640,False,"It should be ready soon."
4641,False,"Any idea how soon?"
4642,False,"I'm afraid not."
4643,False,"Hopefully it won't explode this time..."
4644,False,"Sir, yes, sir!"
4645,False,"You call that a squat!?"
4646,False,"Is everything here yet?"
4647,False,"How goes it?"
4648,False,"Well, it could be worse!"
4649,False,"Don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it."
4650,False,"Understood!"
4651,False,"Maybe I should lighten the load..."
4652,False,"I concur."
4653,False,"Well, there goes my lunch..."
4654,False,"Take it or leave it!"
4655,False,"I wonder what the problem is..."
4656,False,"I'd best make a note of this."
4657,False,"Everything seems fine here."
4658,False,"Not great, but acceptable."
4659,False,"Are you sure you don't need any?"
4660,False,"For the last time, no!"
4661,False,"Oh... I see."
4662,False,"I'll try asking again."
4663,False,"He's persistent, I'll give him that."
4664,False,"Oh gods, I think I've torn my breeches!"
4665,False,"How remarkably informative..."
4666,False,"He held an axe in each hand, and another with his tail!"
4667,False,"We have every garment the discerning professional could possibly need!"
4668,False,"It will make a fine gift."
4669,False,"What could possibly go wrong?"
4670,False,"You certainly have an eye for quality!"
4671,False,"Stop whining!"
4672,False,"I'll show her! I can live on stolen bread!"
4673,False,"Think of the profits we'll make!"
4674,False,"So she told him to take a long walk off a short pier!"
4675,False,"I shall leave it to the chef's discretion."
4676,False,"It all seems in order."
4677,False,"Thank you for keeping an eye on it!"
4678,False,"Don't mention it!"
4679,False,"Hmm... No leaks, no strange noises..."
4680,False,"What say you? Are you in?"
4681,False,"It might be easier to shoot them down with my bow."
4682,False,"Yes, about my room..."
4683,False,"I wonder which is the biggest?"
4684,False,"Where did all of these crumbs come from?"
4685,False,"I'm telling you! It's true!"
4686,False,"I want to be the Exarch this time!"
4687,False,"Lali-ho!"
4688,False,"How go the repairs?"
4689,False,"It's practically like new!"
4690,False,""
4691,False,"Mmmmmm, tastes like samurai..."
4692,False,"I'll have a dozen."
4693,False,"Can't talk─gotta train!"
4694,False,"If you gaze too long into the forest, the forest also gazes into you... "
4695,False,"And for my next trick, a handstand!"
4696,False,"Finlesss one, eh?"
4697,False,"I have a quessstion..."
4698,False,"Are you just going to ssstand there all day!?"
4699,False,"But it is ssso dry!"
4700,False,"But when you consider the
implications of this latest
calamity, you must admit..."
4701,False,"Trust in the scholars.
They will find a solution."
4702,False,"What a precocious
little child!"
4703,False,"If you could perhaps
explain the finer points
of the creation process..."
4704,False,"Yes, yes. Quite right..."
4705,False,"Citizens must be held
to a higher standard..."
4706,False,"They've convened an
emergency assembly."
4707,False,"This concerns us all."
4708,False,"Agreed. We must hurry..."
4709,False,"There's an incredible
concept I just know
you'll adore..."
4710,False,"You... I know...
No, never mind."
4711,False,"The subject's potential
is far beyond our
wildest expectations..."
4712,False,"Where to put this...?"
4713,False,"I'm all for people having fun, but can't they learn to pick up after themselves?"
4714,False,"It's a mess, all right. But it could have been worse."
4715,False,"Look what I found!"
4716,False,"We have to clean up this mess before Master Gegeruju sees it..."
4717,False,"Even pirates clean up better than this!"
4718,False,"At least all the squatting I'm doing is good for my thighs..."

4918,False,"Great! Let's collect lots and decorate with them!"
4919,False,"Phew. I'm glad for that to be over and done with."
4920,False,"We'd best leave the negotiations to Alphinaud and the Exarch."
4921,False,"Perhaps now we have afforded ourselves an audience."
4922,False,"Now they have little choice but to hear our plea."
4923,False,"So, what kind of dream should we spin next?"
4924,False,"I'm not sure. What do you think?"
4925,False,"Hmmm..."
4926,False,"How about...a great big sheep?"

4928,False,"Imagine it─we could drink and play at the same time!"
4929,False,"Oh, that sounds wonderful!"
4930,False,"Let's make lots of big sheep and drown all of Lyhe Mheg in milk!"
4931,False,"Uh... We're going to need to have a little talk..."
4932,False,"How about...a great big beast?"
4933,False,"Something that's a natural predator to the you-know-whats!"
