11,"TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_500_001","A specter of the late Emperor Varis. I suppose even a figment of one's memory, assuming sufficient creative liberties are taken, can prove as fearsome as a man of flesh and blood."
12,"TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_500_002","Admittedly, I cannot claim to have witnessed his prowess firsthand, but who has not heard tales of his savagery, his unparalleled might?"
13,"TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_500_003","Yes, I do believe inspiration has struck, my friend. The brutal battle of words which proceeded a nightmarish clash 'twixt the Emperor and the realm's great liberator."
14,"TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_500_004","“You would dare approach me thus?” Lord Varis scoffed. “Where men of greater strength and mind both would flee, you dare commit to such folly?”"

16,"TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_500_006","An admirable attempt, if I were still learning my letters perhaps. It seems my prose yet wants for inspiration."

19,"TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_000","Gunnhildr's Blades were possessed of not one but myriad weapons with which they saved their queen. Oh, to see the look on the resistance soldiers' faces when Gerolt's work is complete."
20,"TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_001","Wait. Save the Queen? Why do those words sound so familiar... Yes, of course! Queen Gunnhildr was said to wield a holy blade bearing that name. A rather nonsensical moniker, if I may be so bold, but perhaps in ancient tongues it held some sense of grandeur."
21,"TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_002","That Bozjans still speak of her reign with such reverence is testament to their storytelling traditions. Traditions which may very well serve to rekindle the flames of this playwright's spirit."

24,"TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_011","It is said this blade, blessed by the gods, could only be wielded by she who would become queen of Bozja. As such, it was passed down through the ages, along with the title of Queen Gunnhildr, serving as undeniable proof of her sovereignty."
25,"TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_012","A passage I'm certain you have heard repeated ad nauseam. What I read next, however, was a captivating account of how the queen singlehandedly saved her people from certain destruction. "

27,"TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_014","The lands were ablaze with flame, the heavens marred with hues of bloody crimson. Death had come for the people of Bozja, and indeed would claim most as they fled to sanctuary within the castle."
28,"TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_015","All hope seemed lost...
