3,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_201_000","Though I labor to fathom the how or the why of it, I think it best we not speak of it further. Not where others may hear, at least."

Have you given any thought to Ardbert's resurrection?"

14,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_060","Still tending the bar, cleaning up after drunkards and Glynard. If this is the punishment you had in mind, I struggle to fathom a harsher fate!"

16,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_062","This being a bar, most of the folks lending an ear are a few drinks deep, so there's no telling how much of it they retain, or believe for that matter. But I'll keep at it. Stories have a way of spreading."

That said, Ardbert's miraculous return to the land of the living still concerns me. I'd be careful around him if I were you. He seems changed somehow...and I cannot say if it's for the better."

21,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_070","Why, only the greatest villain of her day. The mysterious architect of countless tragedies all across Norvrandt who finally faced justice at the hands of the Warriors of Light. The betrayer whose defeat set in motion events culminating with the Flood of Light. But you knew that much, didn't you?"
22,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_071","Before I took that name, I was known by another in the Thirteenth, a shard all but subsumed by Darkness. There I met with Ascians who convinced me that the only path to salvation was to embrace the Dark and journey unto this world."
23,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_072","I had two objectives. One was to raise up heroes brave and true, worthy champions of the Light─Ardbert and the others. I would join them in their journey and shepherd them unto glory."

25,"TEXT_JOBDEFROLEALL_00620_CYELLA_000_074","My second objective was contingent on the first. I would confront the adventurers forged by hardship into Warriors of Light and strike them down at the height of their power, ensuring that the delicate imbalance between the primordial forces would be preserved just so. But in the end, I failed."
