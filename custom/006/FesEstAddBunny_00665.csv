1,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_GENBU_000_051","(-Wizened Voice-)<Emphasis>Am</Emphasis> I, Soroban? I gave my permission for you to leave the temple to go frolic about in that ridiculous rabbit suit, did I not? Mind you, I am already beginning to regret my decision. At this rate, it will be a thousand years before you are ready to succeed me!"
2,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_GENBU_000_052","I understand this, Master Genbu. Truly, I do! I assure you that this is all part of my mission to expand my horizons and deepen my knowledge of this world, that I might one day protect the Ruby Sea as you do."
3,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_GENBU_000_053","(-Wizened Voice-)Ohohoho! As you can see, this young one is as spirited as ever. It is good to see you in fine fettle as well, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."
4,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_GENBU_000_054","Ohohoho! How long has it been since I traveled to these shores? No matter─I must find myself a great warrior, lest the Ruby Sea be bathed in the flames of destruction..."
5,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_SEIRYU_000_055","Greetings, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. It has been some time, has it not? When I heard of your involvement in these festivities, I was compelled to come and see for myself. I was, however, burdened with an overgrown kitten who can neither swim nor fly, making the journey here troublesome indeed."
6,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_SEIRYU_000_056","Had I known these suits would be so...constrictive, I may have stayed at Hells' Lid. Were I to use my powers to transform you into a snake, you might better understand my struggle."
7,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_SEIRYU_000_057","...But I jest. Such ill treatment of a warrior of your stature would incur the ire of my fellow auspices."
8,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_SEIRYU_000_058","Similarly, were any of them foolish enough to give you cause for consternation, my retribution against them would be swift and merciless."

10,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_BYAKKO_000_060","Well, well, old friend. I was not expecting to see <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> in a place like this. Do you not remember my final words to you when you left the temple?"
11,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_BYAKKO_000_061","I told you that you were welcome to return anytime you wish. And yet, you spurn our invitation. I am filled with such profound loneliness, I can feel my aramitama swell with anger and rage─!"
12,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_BYAKKO_000_062","...'Tis a joke, friend. Perhaps my companions would express such sentiments, but not I."
13,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_BYAKKO_000_063","And yet, I cannot deny that we would welcome your company. After all, you are one of the few mortals in this world that we see as a friend."
14,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_BYAKKO_000_064","Mortals are honorable creatures, indeed... I must keep my fury in check, lest I visit upon them death and destruction they do not deserve."
15,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_SUZAKU_000_065","Let me tell you of a dream I had. In it, I was standing in a great manse, with countless visions of my beloved Tenzen dancing about me. It was so curious, and so deeply beautiful..."

26,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_TATARU_000_101","I was just stopping by to pay a visit to one of our contacts in the Twin Adders, when out of nowhere this fellow in a rabbit suit came by and handed me this egg. Isn't it pretty?"
27,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_TATARU_000_102","It just made me so happy that I figured, why not return the favor? The others won't miss me if I'm only gone for a while, no?"
28,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_TATARU_000_103","A happy Hatching–tide to you! Isn't this such a lovely festival?"

30,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_ALKAZOLKA_000_151","Ever since Setoto was cured of the disease, I've been taking her all around as part of my training. It's such a relief to know she'll not be the target of any overeager bounty hunters anymore!"

34,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_BEATINE_000_201","Mayhap you can assist me with something. I've crafted the most lovely gilded eggs from the finest of wood, yet not a single boy or girl has shown an interest in my creations. Whatever do you suppose might be the matter?"
35,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_GAIRHARD_000_202","Ahem... How many times do I have to tell you? Maybe you'd have more luck if you put that godsdamned saw down before you approached the children!"

40,"TEXT_FESESTADDBUNNY_00665_ADKIRAGH_000_252","And to that, I answer: recently, generous adventurers have given me all manner of curious costumes, from toads to Namazu and more. But I will not be swayed by fleeting trends of fashion. No, I have a style all my own, and I will stay true to myself to the end! Did I mention that suckling pig is one of the most popular items on the menu at the Hard Place?"
