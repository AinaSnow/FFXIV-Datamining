6,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_011","The actual guildmaster, Wawalago, apparently has better things to do than administer a guild, and so it falls to me."
7,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_012","In hindsight, the thought of a fisherman neglecting his duties shouldn't have come as such a surprise to me."

12,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_024","Quite fitting for a self-sufficient adventurer like yourself, do you not agree? After all, what sort of adventurer wants to browse the nets for hours upon hours when you could be enjoying the great outdoors with a rod and reel?"
13,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_030","Well, look what the coeurl dragged in. How goes it, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>?"
14,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_040","Now there's a sight for sore eyes. I believed the Admiral when she said you wriggled through the Ul'dahns' nets, but it's still a comfort to find you here in the flesh."
15,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_041","Aye, most people in positions of power know all about your situation. Wawalago doesn't know a thing, though─and I've a mind to keep it that way. He'd never let a fish slip free from his hook, but a secret from his lips? Now that's a different story."

19,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_080","Ever since you helped solve the mystery of the disappearing harutsuge, it's like a whole new fire's been lit under the guildmaster's behind.

32,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_140","I told Wawalago all about how you'd been fishing in the farthest-flung reaches of the realm. He pretended he was unimpressed, but I could tell he was burning with jealousy deep down inside."
33,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_141","I thought that hearing about your heroics would light a fire under his bone-idle behind, but it didn't quite work in the way I intended..."
