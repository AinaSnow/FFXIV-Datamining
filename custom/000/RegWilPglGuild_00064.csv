1,"TEXT_REGWILPGLGUILD_00064_Q1_000_1","What will you ask?"
2,"TEXT_REGWILPGLGUILD_00064_A1_000_1","Tell me about yourself."

...Hmmm, mayhap it was before your time."

10,"TEXT_REGWILPGLGUILD_00064_HAMON_022","Aye, what a pugilist lacks in destructive force, he makes up for in speed and cunning. Rather than trying to deal great damage with a single blow, he pummels his foe with lightning-fast combinations."

14,"TEXT_REGWILPGLGUILD_00064_HAMON_000_061","You were ever one of my most inquisitive, so the news hardly came as a surprise. Needless to say I'm very proud of you! We ought to go at it a few rounds again, just like the good old days, eh?"
15,"TEXT_REGWILPGLGUILD_00064_HAMON_000_070","Ah, my dear <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Rumor has it you've gotten dragged into some unsavory business. But keep your chin up, you hear? I believe in your innocence─we all do. And those that believe otherwise will have to answer to my fists of fury! Hah hah hah!"
16,"TEXT_REGWILPGLGUILD_00064_HAMON_000_071","Ah, my dear <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! The unsavory business has been settled, so I'm told.

23,"TEXT_REGWILPGLGUILD_00064_HAMON_000_102","Having said that, I must confess I haven't had any success in that arena. With my youthful vigor reclaimed, I thought that I was certain to be popular with the ladies again. Ahhh, I can't imagine what I'm doing wrong."
