0,"TEXT_REGFSTMAGICITEMTIPS_00045_GARRATT_000_1","Just look at this beauty. See how she glows. You can almost <Emphasis>feel</Emphasis> the power running through her."
1,"TEXT_REGFSTMAGICITEMTIPS_00045_Q1_1","Choose a response."
2,"TEXT_REGFSTMAGICITEMTIPS_00045_A1_1","What exactly is it you have there?"
3,"TEXT_REGFSTMAGICITEMTIPS_00045_A1_2","Can we make a deal?"
4,"TEXT_REGFSTMAGICITEMTIPS_00045_A1_3","I think I'll leave you alone with your sword."
5,"TEXT_REGFSTMAGICITEMTIPS_00045_GARRATT_000_10","What is it? Well, what does it look like? It's a shortsword."
6,"TEXT_REGFSTMAGICITEMTIPS_00045_GARRATT_000_11","Ah, but now I suppose you're wondering why all the fuss over a shortsword? That's easy, you see. This isn't your ordinary, run-of-the-mill, mass-forged, store-bought, bottom-of-the-bargain-bin shortsword. This here is a genuine <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>aetherial<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> shortsword."
7,"TEXT_REGFSTMAGICITEMTIPS_00045_GARRATT_000_12","Can't you see its glow? No? Well, trust me. It's there. And that glow means this shortsword is special. It means it's <Emphasis>powerful</Emphasis>...or at least a little more powerful than what you'd normally expect from a mere shortsword."
8,"TEXT_REGFSTMAGICITEMTIPS_00045_GARRATT_000_13","In fact, that's the case with most aetherial gear─though no two pieces are ever alike. Why, it might be that the next time I delve into Sastasha, I'll find an aetherial shortsword even <Emphasis>more</Emphasis> powerful than this one. Then I'll toss this piece of junk to the side of the road like the rubbish it is...not that it's rubbish, mind you."
9,"TEXT_REGFSTMAGICITEMTIPS_00045_GARRATT_000_20","A deal!? Hah! Do you know how long it took me to find this? How many parties I was forced to suffer with greedy bastards who kept claiming all the aetherial loot even though their bags were full of the stuff? No, this sword is <Emphasis>mine</Emphasis>, and if you want it, you'll have to pry it from my cold, dead hands!"
10,"TEXT_REGFSTMAGICITEMTIPS_00045_GARRATT_000_21","Which, in truth, is how aetherial gear comes to be. You've heard of spiritbonds, I assume? That spiritually charged aetherial connection you form with any gear you have equipped? Well, in rare cases, when someone wielding an item with an especially strong spiritbond is slain in battle, the energy created by that bond remains trapped inside, rather than returning to the Lifestream."
11,"TEXT_REGFSTMAGICITEMTIPS_00045_GARRATT_000_22","That energy enhances the gear, and voilà! You have an aetherial shortsword, or an aetherial subligar, or a pair of aetherial goatskin smithy gloves of gathering."
12,"TEXT_REGFSTMAGICITEMTIPS_00045_GARRATT_000_23","The fact that for an item to become aetherial, the owner of that item must perish while having it equipped, usually means that they can only be found in dangerous locations where terrible, bloody battles have occurred. Now, if <Emphasis>I</Emphasis> was looking to get <Emphasis>my</Emphasis> hands on <Emphasis>another</Emphasis> aetherial shortsword, might be that I'd head back inside Sastasha. <wink> <wink>"
