0,"TEXT_REGWILAETHEGUID_00060_NENEBARU_000","Hail, adventurer! If you would know aught of aetherytes and aetherial travel, I, Nenebaru, would be happy to assist you."
1,"TEXT_REGWILAETHEGUID_00060_Q1_000_1","Select a topic."
2,"TEXT_REGWILAETHEGUID_00060_A1_000_1","What is aetherial travel?"
3,"TEXT_REGWILAETHEGUID_00060_A1_000_2","What are aetherytes?"
4,"TEXT_REGWILAETHEGUID_00060_A1_000_3","What is the difference between Return and Teleport?"
5,"TEXT_REGWILAETHEGUID_00060_A1_000_4","Nothing."
6,"TEXT_REGWILAETHEGUID_00060_NENEBARU_010","In order to understand the workings of aetherial travel, one must first understand the nature of aether itself."
7,"TEXT_REGWILAETHEGUID_00060_NENEBARU_011","Aether is an invisible, intangible substance that exists all around us."
8,"TEXT_REGWILAETHEGUID_00060_NENEBARU_012","It flows through every living being, including you and me. It is what sustains us, and without it we would perish."
9,"TEXT_REGWILAETHEGUID_00060_NENEBARU_013","Once the spirit departs the body due to death, our remains are reduced to aether and returned to the aetherial river known as the Lifestream."
10,"TEXT_REGWILAETHEGUID_00060_NENEBARU_014","However, it was long ago discovered that, with sufficient control of one's spiritual energies, a man could deliberately reduce his physical form to aether without severing the connection between body and soul. And so the spells known as Return and Teleport were born."
11,"TEXT_REGWILAETHEGUID_00060_NENEBARU_020","These crystalline agglomerations of aether, which are a common sight throughout Eorzea, are vital to aetherial travel."
12,"TEXT_REGWILAETHEGUID_00060_NENEBARU_021","By touching an aetheryte, you can attune your body's aether with the crystal."
13,"TEXT_REGWILAETHEGUID_00060_NENEBARU_022","Should you fall in battle and your body be reduced to aether, you may awaken back at the aetheryte with which you have the strongest resonance─your “home point.”"
14,"TEXT_REGWILAETHEGUID_00060_NENEBARU_023","With the proper training, however, you can resist the pull of your home point and travel to a different aetheryte."
15,"TEXT_REGWILAETHEGUID_00060_NENEBARU_024","This is the technique commonly referred to as “Teleportation.”"
16,"TEXT_REGWILAETHEGUID_00060_NENEBARU_025","But know that you can only travel to an aetheryte with which you have previously attuned. When visiting an unfamiliar area, you would do well to seek out the nearest aetheryte before engaging in any dangerous activities."
17,"TEXT_REGWILAETHEGUID_00060_NENEBARU_026","In essence, aetherytes act as lodestones, which allow us to move contrary to the natural flow of the Lifestream. But be fairly warned: to attempt aetherial travel without these lodestones is akin to suicide."
18,"TEXT_REGWILAETHEGUID_00060_NENEBARU_030","Compared to Teleport, Return is less taxing on our spiritual energies, as we are naturally drawn towards our “home point”─the aetheryte with which we have the strongest resonance."
19,"TEXT_REGWILAETHEGUID_00060_NENEBARU_031","This spell can be cast quite quickly, making it ideal for emergencies."
20,"TEXT_REGWILAETHEGUID_00060_NENEBARU_032","By way of a drawback, you cannot select your destination at will─Return can only send you back to your home point."
21,"TEXT_REGWILAETHEGUID_00060_NENEBARU_033","Teleport offers greater versatility, in that you can travel to any aetheryte with which you have previously attuned."
22,"TEXT_REGWILAETHEGUID_00060_NENEBARU_034","However, it requires a great deal of spiritual energy known as “anima” to safely guide one's body and soul to the weaker aetherial beacon. Do not worry, though─many adventurers recover quickly and are more than capable of frequent travel. That is, assuming they can afford the costs involved."
23,"TEXT_REGWILAETHEGUID_00060_NENEBARU_035","You see, in the Calamity, many of the aetheryte camps across Eorzea were completely destroyed. Rebuilding these camps came at a great expense, and the money which made this possible was lent by certain wealthy individuals."
24,"TEXT_REGWILAETHEGUID_00060_NENEBARU_036","This debt is being repaid to this day, and it is for this reason that we must levy a fee upon those who use the Teleport spell."
