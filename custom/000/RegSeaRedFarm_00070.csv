1,"TEXT_REGSEAREDFARM_00070_Q1_000_1","What will you ask?"
2,"TEXT_REGSEAREDFARM_00070_A1_000_1","What do you do here?"
3,"TEXT_REGSEAREDFARM_00070_A1_000_2","What kind of place is this?"
4,"TEXT_REGSEAREDFARM_00070_A1_000_3","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_REGSEAREDFARM_00070_ANAOC_000_2","The name's Anaoc, and I run this here farm. I've been a botanist for...well, for more seasons than I can count."
6,"TEXT_REGSEAREDFARM_00070_ANAOC_000_3","I'd retired once, before all that nasty business with the Calamity came down. But I can hardly sit idle with all the rebuilding that needs doing, now, can I?"
7,"TEXT_REGSEAREDFARM_00070_ANAOC_000_4","I am fortunate enough, however, to have a goodly number of enthusiastic youngsters about the place. With a bit of direction from me, I look forward to seeing what wonders they'll achieve at the Stead."

9,"TEXT_REGSEAREDFARM_00070_ANAOC_000_6","And you can see the results just by taking a look around. The crops are bountiful, and we've had to add pens for the extra livestock."

11,"TEXT_REGSEAREDFARM_00070_ANAOC_000_8","If I were to find flaws, it would have to be with our lack of security. Time was that the local pirates would look out for an old farmer like me, but now their whole way of life has been outlawed."
12,"TEXT_REGSEAREDFARM_00070_ANAOC_000_010","Ah, a true friend to the Stead returns. I shudder to think of where I'd be today without ye."
13,"TEXT_REGSEAREDFARM_00070_ANAOC_000_011","Yes, life in the fields carries on. There are the good days and the bad, but ye'll not see me grumbling─no, not when there's work to be done."
14,"TEXT_REGSEAREDFARM_00070_ANAOC_000_012","The threat of the occasional kobold raid remains, but fear's not going to keep this old farmer from working this land to the fullest."
15,"TEXT_REGSEAREDFARM_00070_ANAOC_000_013","As long as there are bountiful harvests to be had, there's no place I'd rather be. If I can live out the rest of my days here, I'll die a happy man."
16,"TEXT_REGSEAREDFARM_00070_ANAOC_000_020","I reckon you know your way 'round the Stead near as well as I do, but if ye'd hear our tale, I'm happy to oblige."
