1,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_011","Sadly, as you can very well see, we have had to close our doors while repairs are underway. As such, we have had no visitors of late, and I find myself with a wealth of spare time."
2,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_013","As a servant of Nald'thal, it saddens me that I have had to put aside my sacred duties for the nonce. I am, however, glad to be afforded the freedom to pursue my interests in the arcane."

There lived at that time in Eorzea a powerful sorceress named Shatotto, who strived to push the destructive power of magic to its very limits."
9,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_021","The typical practice of magi is to weave magic using their own aether. The ability to do so is the greatest magical gift, yet at the same time that gift's greatest limit."
10,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_022","Shatotto was able to overcome such inherent limitations by developing a new technique which allowed her to draw upon the aether all around her as the fount of her magic. It was this technique that came to be known as black magic."
11,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_023","To take up the mantle of black mage is to revive this ancient art and command the aether everywhere to one's will."

25,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_102","Were he still with us, I would call him Master still. But he is not, and few will remember his name as fondly as I do. No, these feelings I must ever keep within..."

30,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_151","The further I delve into the mysteries described within, the more awed I am by Ququruka's devotion to the dark arts─and the destructive power that his devotion unlocked."
31,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_152","I shall not let these grimoires leave my sight. I cannot suffer to see them fall once more into the hands of some crazed madman. The War of the Magi has shown us the dangers inherent in these powers."
32,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_160","To feel the memory of Mistress Shatotto slumbering within me is a most curious sensation. I can feel the vastness of her knowledge, yet at the same time it is ever elusive, just outside my comprehension."
33,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_161","Yet though I cannot grasp the full scope of her power, there could be no greater honor than to be chosen as a vessel by the mother of our art."

39,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_171","To think the day would come when I could peruse the myriads of tomes archived in the Ossuary in broad daylight! Needless to say, there is virtually boundless knowledge that may yet be reaped from this."
40,"TEXT_JOBDEFBLM_00096_LALAI_000_172","By comparing my own findings to those of Master Ququruka, I might learn much of how our art has changed and evolved as it was passed down through the years, and perhaps even unearth and revive aspects of it that have been lost to time."
