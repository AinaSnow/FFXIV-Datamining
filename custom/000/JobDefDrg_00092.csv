6,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRG_00092_ALBERIC_000_3","In the past this duty fell not to the knights of the See, but to a specialized brigade known as the dragoons. In my younger days, I was one of them─verily, their leader, bearing the title of Azure Dragoon."

11,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRG_00092_ALBERIC_000_8","And yet this power is as a double-edged sword, for if the dragoon does not maintain absolute control over his emotions, he shall fall under the thrall of the very wyrms that he would slay. But so it always has been─no great power comes without a cost."
