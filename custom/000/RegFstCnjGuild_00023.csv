7,"TEXT_REGFSTCNJGUILD_00023_ESUMIYAN_000_4","Perchance my childlike appearance gives you cause to doubt my words. It is only natural. Why, to you I must seem to be your junior by no small number of years. Know, however, that I have seen more summers than all but a handful of souls in this great nation."
8,"TEXT_REGFSTCNJGUILD_00023_ESUMIYAN_000_5","Conjury is an art that takes life and the living for its domain. Its primary purpose is the salving of hurts and the granting of protection."
9,"TEXT_REGFSTCNJGUILD_00023_ESUMIYAN_000_6","Adventurers such as yourself oft stand upon the front lines of battle. Owing to this, you are like to find yourself in many situations wherein a capacity for healing would be advantageous. Mind you, there is more to conjury than that."
10,"TEXT_REGFSTCNJGUILD_00023_ESUMIYAN_000_7","By harnessing the power of earth, wind, and water, conjurers are also capable of weaving spells that wreak havoc."
11,"TEXT_REGFSTCNJGUILD_00023_ESUMIYAN_000_8","In terms of sheer destructive power, conjury may pale in comparison to thaumaturgy, but its capacity to defend one against aggression more than compensates for this relative shortcoming."
12,"TEXT_REGFSTCNJGUILD_00023_ESUMIYAN_000_9","In mastering healing and purification, not only will you be able to mend wounds and purge afflictions─you will also be able to breathe life back into the fallen."
13,"TEXT_REGFSTCNJGUILD_00023_ESUMIYAN_000_10","More than simply healers, yet not true dealers of destruction, conjurers realize their full potential when they employ their powers in support of others. This, my dear adventurer, is what it means to be one of us."
14,"TEXT_REGFSTCNJGUILD_00023_ESUMIYAN_000_020","Welcome, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. The elementals oft whisper of the deeds you perform in service to the Twelveswood."
15,"TEXT_REGFSTCNJGUILD_00023_ESUMIYAN_000_030","I was most surprised to hear the murmurings of the great one─that an adventurer had mastered the art of white magic. It seems there are few limits for one such as you."
16,"TEXT_REGFSTCNJGUILD_00023_ESUMIYAN_000_040","Welcome, adventurer. Your heroic deeds have done much to preserve the sanctity of the Twelveswood."
17,"TEXT_REGFSTCNJGUILD_00023_ESUMIYAN_000_050","Welcome, adventurer. Our forest home breathes easier for the great evils you have laid to rest."

21,"TEXT_REGFSTCNJGUILD_00023_ESUMIYAN_000_063","We received word that the Scions have been spirited away to another world not unlike our own. 'Tis little wonder the elementals failed to bring word of their whereabouts."
22,"TEXT_REGFSTCNJGUILD_00023_ESUMIYAN_000_064","Tataru has sent us the glad tidings. I can but imagine the difficulties the Scions must have encountered in their bid to return home, and it fills my heart with joy to know that they are with us again."
23,"TEXT_REGFSTCNJGUILD_00023_Q2_000_1","What will you ask?"
24,"TEXT_REGFSTCNJGUILD_00023_A2_000_1","Of what do the elementals whisper?"
25,"TEXT_REGFSTCNJGUILD_00023_A2_000_2","What can you tell me of conjury?"

27,"TEXT_REGFSTCNJGUILD_00023_ESUMIYAN_000_100","Sylphie oft catches the elementals' attention of late. The young conjurer attends to her studies with an impassioned vigor that surprises─and even inspires─her fellow initiates."
28,"TEXT_REGFSTCNJGUILD_00023_ESUMIYAN_000_101","With such dedication and determination, it shall not be long before she earns the title of “Hearer.” Truly, your guidance has made of her a shining example for others to follow."

31,"TEXT_REGFSTCNJGUILD_00023_ESUMIYAN_000_120","When the nightmarish pall was lifted from the Lost City of Amdapor, the wind carried to me your name─the name of the Twelveswood's savior."
32,"TEXT_REGFSTCNJGUILD_00023_ESUMIYAN_000_121","Amdapor was not always thus afflicted. Indeed, the city once owed an age of prosperity to the benevolent art of white magic. But that was before the War of the Magi."
33,"TEXT_REGFSTCNJGUILD_00023_ESUMIYAN_000_123","It is told that the enemies of the Amdapori abandoned all caution in their pursuit of victory, and used their dark magicks to summon a king among demons. ...I imagine this abhorrent entity is the very evil you slew in the depths of the ruins."
34,"TEXT_REGFSTCNJGUILD_00023_ESUMIYAN_000_124","Though the mages of Amdapor eventually succeeded in imprisoning this fell creature, its recent resurgence speaks eloquently of the impermanence and unpredictability of arcane energies."
