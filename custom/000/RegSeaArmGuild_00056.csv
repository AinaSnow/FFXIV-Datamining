0,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_1","Are you just seeking to pass the time, or do you have an honest interest in armorcraft?"
1,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_Q1_000_1","What would you like to know?"
2,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_A1_000_1","What do you do here?"
3,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_A1_000_2","Tell me about crafting armor."
4,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_A1_000_3","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_2","Me? Hah! You must be new in Limsa. I'm H'naanza, the head of Naldiq & Vymelli's, forgemaster and shipwright."
6,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_3","I spend a good portion of my time here in the Armorers' Guild, trying to hammer my novices into something resembling true artisans."
7,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_4","We lost too many of our skilled veterans to that damn Calamity. Too many..."
8,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_100_4","I see it as my Builder-given duty to not only pass on the techniques of the armorer to the next generation of artisans, but to improve on those processes as well."
9,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_5","At a glance, working a sheet of plate seems simple. You take your chosen metal, then heat, hammer, and bend until you achieve the desired shape and thickness."
10,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_6","There is, however, much more to the process. An armorer needs to learn how to work materials of varying hardness, such as bronze and iron. And shaping them into gauntlets, shields, and helmets is no easy task."
11,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_7","You must direct your blows with strength and surety as would a smitty, but an armorer needs something a smitty doesn't: delicacy. Without that, it wouldn't be long before tiny flaws crept in to compromise the defensive strength of the plate."
12,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_8","We make works of art with flame and steel, and there's never a day that I'm not damn proud to be an armorer."
13,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_010","Greetings, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Have you come to help hammer the dents out of some of my novices, or was there something else I could do for you?"
14,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_020","Greetings, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Seems you've a knack for landing yourself in the midst of ugly situations. But not to worry─once the blaze dies down, the purity of your steel will be revealed for all to see."
15,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_021","Stay here as long as you please. My hammer and I will see to any characters foolish enough to seek trouble at <Emphasis>my</Emphasis> forge."
16,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_030","Greetings, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. How fares your work with Blanstyr? I know he can be a difficult old sod, but if any can show him the error of his ways, it is you."
17,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_040","Greetings, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I must thank you again for the patience you have shown with Blanstyr. As ever, you are the living embodiment of everything for which this guild stands."
18,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_050","Greetings, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I still have yet to receive word from Blanstyr. How am I to know if the old aldgoat even arrived in the Far East...?"
19,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_060","Aye, I was finally handed a letter with atrocious penmanship telling me that a certain veteran artisan had safely found himself a Far Eastern tutor. Blanstyr can be trying, I know, but I would consider it a personal favor if you could keep an eye on him."
20,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_070","Greetings, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Again, I must thank you for overseeing Blanstyr's impetuous pilgrimage. Considering the knowledge you gained in the process, I expect great things from you as well!"
21,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_Q2_000_001","What will you ask?"
22,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_A2_000_001","How fares the guild?"
23,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_A2_000_002","What can you tell me of armorcraft?"
24,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_A2_000_003","Nothing."
25,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_100","There has been scant trouble to speak of─especially since Blanstyr made the decision to distance himself from our forges."
26,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_101","But though the guild has been blessedly free of friction, this was not necessarily the outcome for which I had hoped."
27,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_102","Far better if he were to have embraced the idea of friendly rivalry. Alas, such a fundamental shift in perspective will not be soon in the offing for a stubborn old aurochs like him."
28,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_150","Now that Blanstyr is around the forges once more, I see my novices perspiring from more than the heat. It might be that they fear his tongue-lashings more than mine."
29,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_151","But judging by the increase in quality and production, sometimes a little pressure is not a bad thing. The old buzzard can be good for the guild...if we can steer him onto the right track."
30,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_160","I would like to say that Blanstyr has mellowed after his time working with you, but it seems he has merely swapped one brand of stubbornness for another─the old aurochs is perfectly serious about his contest with me."
31,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_161","But if he thinks to out-forge the forgemaster, then he had best think again. My work for Naldiq & Vymelli's comes first, of course, but I will sacrifice sleep to craft my competition pieces, if needs be."
32,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_162","...I might be enjoying this rivalry despite myself. There is a certain thrill to matching one's work against a competitor that cannot be found in hammering out commissions. I am glad to have him back..."
33,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_100_170","I was honestly surprised by Blanstyr's decision to leave on this pilgrimage of his. He is an asset to the guild and his absence concerns me, but an artisan must be free to pursue new methods and ideas."
34,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_110_170","If he returns a better armorer, then I shall not regret the time spent covering his clients' requests."
35,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_200_170","Blanstyr finally took the time to send me a letter─even if the contents were barely legible. Thank you for checking on his well-being."
36,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_210_170","If the old aurochs returns a better armorer, then I shall consider the time spent covering his clients' requests well spent."
37,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_170","Blanstyr's never been away for so long before. The lack of conflict is a touch unsettling, but I've been kept busy adjusting and repairing armor for his usual clients."
38,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_171","It was a strange thing to hear him talk about this pilgrimage. The stubborn bugger's always been at odds with his fellow armorers, and I never imagined he'd willingly seek out a teacher."
39,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_172","He's certainly changed for the better, and I look forward to seeing what learning these new techniques has done for the character of his work. Of course, as his rival this means I'll need to learn some innovation of my own!"
40,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_110","You wish me to lecture you like you were a fresh-faced initiate? An odd request, but not as uncommon as you might think. Very well─stand up straight, and pay attention!"
41,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_111","At a glance, working a sheet of plate seems simple. You take your chosen metal, then heat, hammer, and bend until you achieve the desired shape and thickness."
