0,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000","Greetings! Is there something you want to ask about the Goldsmiths' Guild?"
1,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_Q1_000_1","What will you ask?"
2,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_A1_000_1","What do you do here?"
3,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_A1_000_2","What is goldsmithing?"
4,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_A1_000_3","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_A1_000_4","Can I have another set of earrings?"
6,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_010","People call me Mistress Serendipity, but you can call me Sera!"
7,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_011","I was recently appointed guildmaster, so this is all still quite new to me. My predecessor abruptly retired, you see...but that's a long, sordid story that I'm sure you'd rather not hear."
8,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_012","Now, I may not have much experience managing people, but I <Emphasis>am</Emphasis> a very good goldsmith─even if I do say so myself! Those who train under me are guaranteed to learn a thing or two!"
9,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_020","Though we're called <Emphasis>gold</Emphasis>smiths, we actually work with various kinds of precious metals and gemstones, all of which are abundant in Thanalan."
10,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_021","Smelting, casting, cutting, polishing─we use all these techniques to craft beautiful baubles that delight the eyes."
11,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_022","Mind you, the things we make aren't simply for show─a great many possess magical properties. And of course, we craft scepters and staves that thaumaturges use to channel their magicks."
12,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_023","When you think about all the variety goldsmithing has to offer, it's really quite exciting!"
13,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_030","You want <Emphasis>what</Emphasis>!? You can't be serious! <Emphasis>Gods</Emphasis>..."
14,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_031","Just this once, but remember─life is not a minstrel's song, and you aren't some chosen hero. So don't go around expecting people to forgive you no matter the reckless, irresponsible things you do."
15,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_040","Why, hello there, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. How is our little princess doing?"
16,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_041","Sorry, sorry. That was a bit rude of me, wasn't it. How are <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> doing?"
17,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_061","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Are the rumors true? Are you the victim of a vast conspiracy!? Oh dear, I probably shouldn't speak so loudly..."
18,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_062","I've given thought to how we might distract your pursuers. Perhaps a mammet fashioned in your image which nods at regular intervals? No? Hmmm...I was rather proud of that idea..."
19,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_050","Ah! <Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>! How's every little thing? You haven't been trying to repair mammets behind my back, have you?"
20,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_070","Hard at work on your commission for Marcel, I see. His clients are demanding, but if anyone can produce a masterpiece that will win them over, it's you─I'm sure of it!"
21,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_075","As guildmaster, allow me to offer my most sincere congratulations and commendations for your work on those most magnificent music boxes. Marcel was practically dancing on his way back to Eshtaime's!"
22,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_076","Perhaps you noticed, but Master Colbernoux was with me in the Quicksand when you unveiled your creations. He looked me straight in the eye and said it was a true masterpiece worthy of his muse. You should be proud, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>─my master isn't one to give praise lightly!"
23,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_080","It won't be easy teaching our craft in a foreign land, but it's a worthwhile cause. And with you in charge, I have every confidence that things will go swimmingly!"
24,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_085","So, it's off to Gyr Abania. Things may get a little hairy on the road, so take care, alright?"
25,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_090","Oh, the orchestrion you made for the sultana is simply adorable! I would love to have one just like it. You know, my nameday <Emphasis>is</Emphasis> coming up soon..."
26,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_095","Ah, to what do I owe the honor, Schoolmaster <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,2)/>? ...Hehe, I'll bet you enjoyed being called that!"
27,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_Q2_000_001","What will you ask?"
28,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_A2_000_001","How fares the guild?"
29,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_A2_000_002","What is goldsmithing?"
30,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_A2_000_003","Nothing."
31,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_A2_000_4","Can I have another set of earrings?"
32,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_100","So very, very busy! Our members are working day and night to fill commissions for clients throughout Eorzea, and of course I must supervise. I swear, sometimes it feels as though I never leave this spot!"
33,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_101","I like that it keeps me occupied. When it's not so busy, I start to wonder about silly things, like if he would've really pulled the trigger..."
34,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_102","Perhaps I'm due for a sabbatical. I've been thinking about it more ever since a client of ours invited me to his beachside holdings in eastern La Noscea."
35,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_103","Of course, the moment I tell Gigi about Gegeruju's offer, he begins raving about “secrets and lies” again. I mean, I know Gigi was right about Robert or whatever his name was, but what ulterior motives could Gegeruju possibly have?"
36,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_105","Busier and busier─and in no small part due to the acclaim your twin music boxes have won, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. This is a good thing, of course...not that it stops Gigi from complaining."
37,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_106","Oh, yes, he's back to his usual self. Why, if I didn't know better, I'd even say the new cylinder you fashioned for him has augmented his vocabulary of oaths and obscenities tenfold."
38,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_107","Why, just the other day he had the nerve to compare my girth to that of an overstuffed goobbue! Now, it's true that my waist size has grown by one-sixteenth of an ilm since I last measured, but that's hardly cause for insults, wouldn't you say?"
39,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_108","Why, I might enjoy a piece of pineapple ponzecake from time to time, but if anything I'm healthier than I've always been! Not that a spindly little mammet would know anything about how difficult it is for a woman to watch her figure...but what were we talking about, again?"
40,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_100_110","How we're faring? I thought you'd never ask, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>!"
41,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_100_111","I am proud to say that I have lost weight! One-thirty-second of an ilm around the waist, to be precise."
42,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_100_112","Gigi said so, so it must be true. He has an eye for these things, for better or worse, and he never lies...for better or worse."
43,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_100_113","Well, to be sure, one-thirty-second of an ilm may not sound like much, but to us goldsmiths it is the difference between a crude bauble and a masterpiece. Of which I am, of course, the latter."
44,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_110","Ahaha─ Oh, you're serious. Well, if you really want me to explain it to you..."
45,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_111","Though we're called <Emphasis>gold</Emphasis>smiths, we actually work with various kinds of precious metals and gemstones, all of which are abundant in Thanalan."

48,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_114","...Out of curiosity, are you feeling well? You didn't hit your head on something, did you? No? Hmmm... Maybe you don't remember doing it...?"
49,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_TALK_ACTOR","Greetings! Is there something you want to ask about the Goldsmiths' Guild?"
