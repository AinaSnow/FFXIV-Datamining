1,"TEXT_JOBDEFWAR_00090_CURIOUSGORGE_000_3","My reasons for coming to this land are twofold. One, to pay a debt to an old comrade from the days before the Calamity by protecting the villages here. Two, to spread the battle techniques perfected by my ancestors, that our proud line of warriors does not end with me."
2,"TEXT_JOBDEFWAR_00090_CURIOUSGORGE_000_1","What is it? I've got no words to mince with whelps...unless, that is, you're here to become a wolf."

8,"TEXT_JOBDEFWAR_00090_CURIOUSGORGE_000_6","Where I hail from, up in the mountains of flame to the north, there's barely enough food to go around. Smoldering rock doesn't make for good farmland, you see. In the old days, the warriors of our clan traveled far and wide, earning good coin for their esteemed services."
9,"TEXT_JOBDEFWAR_00090_CURIOUSGORGE_000_7","In recent years, however, we find ourselves shunned by those selfsame peoples we once protected. This, in turn, has led to more and more of our young ones choosing to forsake the warrior's path. A sad fate for our once-proud tribe, it is."
10,"TEXT_JOBDEFWAR_00090_CURIOUSGORGE_000_8","And so I have traveled here, with no possessions save the armor on my back and the ancient text passed down from my ancestors. A text that tells of the history and techniques of my people─and, sadly, a text I can scarcely read."

12,"TEXT_JOBDEFWAR_00090_CURIOUSGORGE_000_120","Ah, you're looking fierce as ever! How fares your training? Surely with the techniques of eld at your disposal you're challenging all manner of beasts. I'm still reacquainting myself with my axe, but fear not─before long I'll be swinging it as powerfully as you!"
13,"TEXT_JOBDEFWAR_00090_CURIOUSGORGE_000_150","Don't forget my promise! When we spar, I'll test the limits of even <Emphasis>your</Emphasis> strength. I won't rest my axe until we can meet again as equals."
14,"TEXT_JOBDEFWAR_00090_CURIOUSGORGE_000_180","Ah, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I trust all is well with my brother and Dorgono? Wish that I could say my training is going well, but it seems my path to recovery has been slow and laden with setbacks."
15,"TEXT_JOBDEFWAR_00090_CURIOUSGORGE_000_210","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! What brings you here? I thought you would be traveling the realm, testing your axe on any beast foolish enough to cross your path. If you've been neglecting your training, I suggest you get back to it, lest I steal your title as realm's greatest warrior!"
16,"TEXT_JOBDEFWAR_00090_CURIOUSGORGE_000_240","Training hard or hardly training, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? Do not doubt that Dorgono and I are making great strides as warriors, and that the day will soon come when we can challenge your supremacy!"

22,"TEXT_JOBDEFWAR_00090_CURIOUSGORGE_000_100","Well enough, thank you, though the specter of my inner beast is ever present, as is the fear of losing myself to its savage call."
23,"TEXT_JOBDEFWAR_00090_CURIOUSGORGE_000_101","As such, I devote the better part of my days to my training, mind as well as body. And when Wineport calls for aid, I answer. These humble efforts alone cannot begin to atone for the suffering caused by the beast, but I must do what I can."
24,"TEXT_JOBDEFWAR_00090_CURIOUSGORGE_000_130","I've been lending my strength to the Maelstrom at Wheiskaet's behest. Those kobolds make for better training than a dummy!"
25,"TEXT_JOBDEFWAR_00090_CURIOUSGORGE_000_131","My brother, however, has chosen to retire from his journey along the path of the warrior, instead focusing his efforts on the ancient tomes."
26,"TEXT_JOBDEFWAR_00090_CURIOUSGORGE_000_132","He scours them night after night in search of anything that might aid us in our dream to bring our ancestor's teachings to people across Eorzea. One day, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, I'll be able to show the realm a warrior's true strength, as you have."

28,"TEXT_JOBDEFWAR_00090_CURIOUSGORGE_000_161","Broken Mountain's knowledge of the ancient tomes is vast, and teaching is like second nature to him. We've received nothing but praise from those under our tutelage."

30,"TEXT_JOBDEFWAR_00090_CURIOUSGORGE_000_163","However, I've little time to train myself, now that I'm training others. But make no mistake, I've not given up on my dream of one day meeting you as an equal. Be ready─we'll be sparring before long!"
31,"TEXT_JOBDEFWAR_00090_CURIOUSGORGE_000_190","As I said, my progress is slow, but nothing you or my brother need concern yourselves with. Though I cannot deny my inner beast, or lack thereof, concerns me."
32,"TEXT_JOBDEFWAR_00090_CURIOUSGORGE_000_191","Ever since Dorgono bested me at Wolves' Den Pier it has fallen utterly silent."
33,"TEXT_JOBDEFWAR_00090_CURIOUSGORGE_000_192","I can only assume the cause is some weakness within myself I have overlooked."
34,"TEXT_JOBDEFWAR_00090_CURIOUSGORGE_000_193","At any rate, a warrior without his inner beast is unfit to lead, which is why I left the Maelstrom's forces to Brother and rejoined the Marauders' Guild."
35,"TEXT_JOBDEFWAR_00090_CURIOUSGORGE_000_194","After a thorough reevaluation of my axework I'm sure to be in peak condition, and ready for a rematch with Dorgono."
36,"TEXT_JOBDEFWAR_00090_CURIOUSGORGE_000_220","Since returning here, I have focused my complete and undivided attention on training. I owe that much to the warrior's recruits for being unfit to train them."
37,"TEXT_JOBDEFWAR_00090_CURIOUSGORGE_000_221","That being said, I'm confident my brother's vast knowledge of combat arts is more than sufficient to guide them along the path of the warrior."
38,"TEXT_JOBDEFWAR_00090_CURIOUSGORGE_000_222","Though I walk that path alone, I have you to inspire me. Mark my words: when next I leave the shores of Costa del Sol, it will be to show you <Emphasis>and</Emphasis> Dorgono the true strength of a warrior."
