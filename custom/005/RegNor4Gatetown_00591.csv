4,"TEXT_REGNOR4GATETOWN_00591_A1_000_003","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_REGNOR4GATETOWN_00591_THYTH_000_010","Much the same as everyone else, I s'pose─just tryin' to survive. Used to be a fisherman, but then I got it into my head that Eulmore was the place for me. No more shiverin' on a boat, or scalin' fish in a shack, no sir."
6,"TEXT_REGNOR4GATETOWN_00591_THYTH_000_011","Wasn't long afore I realized my fishin' skills weren't exactly in high demand. Still, Gatetown ain't so bad...not once you learn to ignore the smell, anyroad."
7,"TEXT_REGNOR4GATETOWN_00591_THYTH_000_012","Aye, I've no desire to go back to where I was. When I left, I cut ties with everything─my home, my family, all of it. I'm content to live on leavings from Eulmore's tables, and await my chance to seize the good life."
8,"TEXT_REGNOR4GATETOWN_00591_THYTH_000_014","For a time I lived on leavings from Eulmore's tables, awaitin' my chance to seize the good life. But the new mayor's made some changes, and it seems that way of life's going to come to an end."
9,"TEXT_REGNOR4GATETOWN_00591_THYTH_000_015","From now on you've got to make your own meol, as it were. That's how it always used to be, I s'pose, but I'm still strugglin' to come to terms with it all."
10,"TEXT_REGNOR4GATETOWN_00591_THYTH_000_020","What? Gatetown? It's a place to feed on the scraps what fall on your face as you look up and hope and dream."
11,"TEXT_REGNOR4GATETOWN_00591_THYTH_000_021","At least with Lord Vauthry in charge, we've naught to fear from the eaters. And you can't hardly complain when they hand out food and ask for naught in return!"
12,"TEXT_REGNOR4GATETOWN_00591_THYTH_000_022","Once you're chosen, though, ah... They say it's like livin' in a whole 'nother world. You just need to polish a skill, and get yourself noticed by a free citizen. One day, my friend, one day!"
13,"TEXT_REGNOR4GATETOWN_00591_THYTH_000_023","Though as it happens, I hear them scraps weren't just some kind of fancy bread. They say we've been eatin' <Emphasis>eaters</Emphasis>. Ugh, when I think of how much meol I've wolfed down, it makes me sick to my stomach."

16,"TEXT_REGNOR4GATETOWN_00591_THYTH_000_031","But change is comin'. Them folk upstairs are sayin' there'll be work for them as have the will, or if you rather, you can go off to start anew elsewhere."
17,"TEXT_REGNOR4GATETOWN_00591_THYTH_000_032","I couldn't say what's in store for Gatetown. Might be as it's made part of Eulmore, might be as it's left to rot and rust. But whatever happens, I reckon it'll be better than what we had before."
