9,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTISHIBUSHI_00529_HACHISUBA_000_018","I will say one thing for those Garleans─they certainly know how to build. We were getting nowhere with the tools we had, so we had to import ones better suited to taking apart steel structures. And explosives. Lots of explosives."

22,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTISHIBUSHI_00529_HACHISUBA_000_028","A statue!? I think that is a little beyond our level of expertise. And I doubt that Lord Hien would be pleased by something so ostentatious."
23,"TEXT_CTSDOMRECONSTRUCTISHIBUSHI_00529_HACHISUBA_000_029","Perhaps practicality should take precedence over aesthetics. I know! How about turning the watchtower into a lighthouse? That way, the port can receive merchant ships even at night!"
