1,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA3GUIDE1_00517_INV00463_000_010","Can you believe what's happened to the proto-aetheryte? I sure can't! Honestly, I don't know what to make of it...which is all the more reason for me to distract myself with my research into the Eureka of legend. Would you like me to tell you about it?"
2,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA3GUIDE1_00517_INV00463_000_020","Don't mind me─I'm still poring over tomes, trying to learn what I can about ancient Allag's Eureka of legend. Maybe I could tell you about it?"
3,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA3GUIDE1_00517_A1_000_000","What will you ask about?"
4,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA3GUIDE1_00517_Q1_000_001","The ancient legend of Eureka."
5,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA3GUIDE1_00517_Q1_000_002","The location of Eureka."

8,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA3GUIDE1_00517_INV00463_000_030","The first thing you need to know about the ancient legend is that there is more than one! Though, I suppose you could say that the various extant fragments add up to a single legend's worth of information."
9,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA3GUIDE1_00517_INV00463_000_031","Alas, given the myriad sources from which it's been compiled, what we know is full of contradictions. But what we can say for certain is that it was a grand labyrinth constructed in the twilight days of the Allagan Empire, in which weapons of terrible power were squirreled away!"
10,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA3GUIDE1_00517_INV00463_000_032","I say we can say this for certain, but due to all the contradictions surrounding other details, most scholars have long since dismissed Eureka as a faerie tale deserving of no further scrutiny."
11,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA3GUIDE1_00517_INV00463_000_033","At least that was the case until the Seventh Umbral Calamity unearthed the Crystal Tower, which was also previously believed to be wholly fictional. After that, well, everybody stood up and took notice, including the Sons of Saint Coinach and the Students of Baldesion."
12,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA3GUIDE1_00517_INV00463_000_040","I'm glad you asked! You see, according to most sources, Eureka was buried beneath the Crystal Tower!"
13,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA3GUIDE1_00517_INV00463_000_041","The tales sometimes describe the structures as being related to one another in some fashion, so when the Sons of Saint Coinach started poking around the Crystal Tower, there was an expectation that they'd find evidence of the legendary labyrinth as well."
14,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA3GUIDE1_00517_INV00463_000_042","Unfortunately, their efforts thus far have yielded nothing save an increasing certainty that wherever Eureka is, it is definitely <Emphasis>not</Emphasis> beneath the Crystal Tower. But hey, knowing where not to look is still a step in the right direction, is it not?"
15,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA3GUIDE1_00517_INV00463_000_050","That there is the million gil question, isn't it? What wondrous and terrifying weapons of unimaginable destructive power could be contained within Eureka?"
16,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA3GUIDE1_00517_INV00463_000_051","Untested Allagan prototypes with the potential to reshape the world. Cursed relics obtained by Archmagus Noah through a pact made with the rulers of the voidsent. Or perhaps sacred treasures bequeathed to mankind by the gods of eld! The possibilities are endless!"
17,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA3GUIDE1_00517_INV00463_000_052","Alas, this is one of the points of contention upon which the extant sources do not agree. It may well be that the authors of these accounts from the Third Astral Era had no idea what weapons had been hidden inside Eureka, and so let their imaginations and their writing run wild!"
