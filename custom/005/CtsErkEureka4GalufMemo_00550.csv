1,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA4GALUFMEMO_00550_SYSTEM_200_000","Hidden beneath the pile of tomes, you discover a single sheet of parchment─Galuf Baldesion's memo."
2,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA4GALUFMEMO_00550_EUREKAMEMO_000_000","(-Galuf's Memo-)I, Galuf Baldesion, hereby commit these words to parchment in the event that the unthinkable should come to pass."
3,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA4GALUFMEMO_00550_EUREKAMEMO_000_001","(-Galuf's Memo-)You who are reading this will by now be aware of the existence of the eikon Eureka and its ability to forge dangerous weapons."
4,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA4GALUFMEMO_00550_EUREKAMEMO_000_002","(-Galuf's Memo-)What you may not know, however, is that said ability is not limited to simply implements of war. Nay, Eureka is capable of creating any and all things."
5,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA4GALUFMEMO_00550_EUREKAMEMO_000_003","(-Galuf's Memo-)And the implications of this? Imagine, if you will, that he who is Eureka's master commands it to create a new Mothercrystal. The eikon would attempt to do so, we believe, even if it meant draining the land of all its aether."
6,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA4GALUFMEMO_00550_EUREKAMEMO_000_004","(-Galuf's Memo-)Such a reforging of the world would entail destruction of a scale to rival any calamity. This is the true danger of Eureka."
7,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA4GALUFMEMO_00550_EUREKAMEMO_000_005","(-Galuf's Memo-)For long years we kept the being's location a closely guarded secret, but in spite of our best efforts, it was eventually discovered by the Ascians."
8,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA4GALUFMEMO_00550_EUREKAMEMO_000_006","(-Galuf's Memo-)Lest Eureka be used to a calamitous end, my comrades and I resorted to drastic measures. Having given the order to evacuate, we invoked a powerful magick to drown the entire isle within the Lifestream."
9,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA4GALUFMEMO_00550_EUREKAMEMO_000_007","(-Galuf's Memo-)Thence we combined our strength to defeat the Ascian known as Emmerololth, consigning her essence to be scattered within that raging torrent of aether, never again to reform."
10,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA4GALUFMEMO_00550_EUREKAMEMO_000_008","(-Galuf's Memo-)And now, we await our own end. Even as I write, the Isle of Val drifts in the Lifestream. Ere long it will become as one with the flow─as will all that remains within."
11,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA4GALUFMEMO_00550_EUREKAMEMO_000_009","(-Galuf's Memo-)However, that these words have survived means that, unlikely though it is, the isle has somehow reemerged in the corporeal realm. It means that Eureka remains a grave threat."
12,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA4GALUFMEMO_00550_EUREKAMEMO_000_010","(-Galuf's Memo-)You who have found my message─to you I make the most urgent of entreaties. Seek out the Scions of the Seventh Dawn and alert them to these events. See that Eureka is sealed away and guard it from those who would use its power for ill. The fate of the very star depends upon it."
