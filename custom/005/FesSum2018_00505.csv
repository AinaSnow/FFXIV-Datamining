8,"TEXT_FESSUM2018_00505_ETHELIA_000_020","Several years ago, the Adventurers' Guild formed the Cascadiers to combat an invasion of rampaging Bombards. The Moonfire Faire was first held to attract new members to the cause."
9,"TEXT_FESSUM2018_00505_ETHELIA_000_021","It proved so popular that it has been held annually ever since, whether the Bombards appear or not. It helps spread word of the guild's activities and generate interest among potential new recruits. In charge of the proceedings is the grand chaperone, Haermaga."

16,"TEXT_FESSUM2018_00505_ETHELIA_000_042","To succeed, challengers will need endurance, dexterity, and nerves of steel─qualities required of an adventurer when exploring monster-infested catacombs and the like. Only in this case, there's no chance of them being horribly killed! Well, almost none."
17,"TEXT_FESSUM2018_00505_ETHELIA_000_043","Naturally, a prize awaits those who overcome this seemingly insurmountable trial. So? Has your interest been piqued?"

23,"TEXT_FESSUM2018_00505_ETHELIA_000_062","It may seem tricky at first, but there's no need to rush. There is no time limit, and the prize is the same regardless of how long it takes you to reach the end."
24,"TEXT_FESSUM2018_00505_ETHELIA_000_063","Don't worry if you take a plunge─simply return to the beginning of that section and try again! You can do this as many times as necessary. Just so you know, the first two sections begin with a ride on a jet of water! Very original, I'm sure you will agree."
25,"TEXT_FESSUM2018_00505_ETHELIA_000_064","There's a lot more I could tell you about the course, but there really is no substitute for experiencing it for yourself, from the thrills through to the spills. Do go out there and give it a try!"
