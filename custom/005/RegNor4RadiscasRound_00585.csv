1,"TEXT_REGNOR4RADISCASROUND_00585_MENTHER_000_020","The Eulmoran forces have drawn to our very doorstep. I encourage you to curtail any unnecessary activities outside the walls. Should you have any concerns, just say the word."
2,"TEXT_REGNOR4RADISCASROUND_00585_MENTHER_000_030","The Eulmorans have gone home, thank the gods, and finally we can resume shipping supplies to the city. Is there something you need of me?"
3,"TEXT_REGNOR4RADISCASROUND_00585_MENTHER_000_050","We suffered great losses in the battle against the sin eater horde, in manpower and supplies both. It will not be easy to rebuild and restock our resources, but we must do what we can. Anyhow, what might I do for you?"
4,"TEXT_REGNOR4RADISCASROUND_00585_MENTHER_000_060","In those fleeting days when the night had returned to us, we would climb as high up on the parapets as we could, that we could get an ever closer glimpse of the starry heavens. What I would not give to gaze upon such sights once more..."
5,"TEXT_REGNOR4RADISCASROUND_00585_MENTHER_000_070","With the Light banished once and for all, trade is flourishing here in Lakeland. Though the danger is not what it once was, stray sin eaters, beasts, and bandits still pose a threat. We are as busy as ever, and yet, we go about our duties with a newfound sense of hope. "

10,"TEXT_REGNOR4RADISCASROUND_00585_MENTHER_000_200","Me? I'm just a soldier, little more than that. I serve here at the Round, doing my part to see that travelers and traders can walk the roads in safety. That's easier said than done, of course."
11,"TEXT_REGNOR4RADISCASROUND_00585_MENTHER_000_201","Whether it's stray sin eaters, slavering fiends, or just your garden variety bandits and brigands, there are more dangers out there than you can shake a stick at. So we take turns: sometimes keeping watch, and sometimes venturing outside the walls to clean things up ourselves."
12,"TEXT_REGNOR4RADISCASROUND_00585_MENTHER_000_202","I never planned on joining the guard, you know. Then, one day, a merchant was gored to death by a sin eater not malms from this place. A merchant who just so happened to be my closest friend. I signed up the next day, and requested the Round as my post. Damned if I'll let another man die on my watch, I said."
13,"TEXT_REGNOR4RADISCASROUND_00585_MENTHER_000_210","It was hard for all of us when the Eulmoran forces struck. Friends, family, good men and good women dying horrible deaths all around us, and all we could do is look on from our posts. I would've given anything to fight by their side, but we had our orders."
14,"TEXT_REGNOR4RADISCASROUND_00585_MENTHER_000_211","If I never see another nightmare like that for as long as I live, it'll be too soon, I say. And I reckon all my brothers and sisters in arms share that sentiment."
15,"TEXT_REGNOR4RADISCASROUND_00585_MENTHER_000_400","This here tower is Radisca's Round. It serves the dual role of a watchtower to guard the highroads from sin eaters and other threats, as well as a waypoint for supplies shipped to and from the Crystarium."
16,"TEXT_REGNOR4RADISCASROUND_00585_MENTHER_000_401","You're probably wondering just who this “Radisca” is. He was a member of the guard in the early days, stationed right here in this tower when it went by another name. With his eagle eyes, he spotted a sin eater horde moving in from a distance, and sent immediate warning to the local residents."
17,"TEXT_REGNOR4RADISCASROUND_00585_MENTHER_000_402","As a result, they were able to evacuate the people almost to the last man, and casualties were kept to an absolute minimum. Sadly, one of those lost was Radisca himself, as he stayed behind to assist in the evacuations till the end. Though he fell to the razor-sharp claw of a sin eater that day, his name and legacy live on here where he drew his last breath."
