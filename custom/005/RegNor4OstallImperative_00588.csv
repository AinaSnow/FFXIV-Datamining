Things were all right at first, then I lost my parents, and suffice to say that orphans aren't treated kindly there. Once I realized it was either get out or starve to death, I got out. Before I knew it, I'd found my way here."
11,"TEXT_REGNOR4OSTALLIMPERATIVE_00588_PAULARD_000_201","Suffice to say, it was like night and day.
