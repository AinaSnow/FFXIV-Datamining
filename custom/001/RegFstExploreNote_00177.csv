My ancestors strode into the unknown, that they might commit to parchment the lay of the land and curve of the shores for all mankind."

Well that, my friend, is the work of an Ironheart─my grandpapa Roddard, to be precise. His descendants have since followed in his pioneering footsteps, my brother Nedrick and myself included."

Should you be so inclined, pray return to me when your travels are done. I would like nothing more than to share impressions with a fellow sensitive soul."
5,"TEXT_REGFSTEXPLORENOTE_00177_MILLITHIRONHEART_100_012","I see that your explorations have led you to my cousin Kester. Oft he would regale me of the many sights and splendors of Ishgard. Oh, to think that you have journeyed there to gaze upon such wonders with your own eyes!"
6,"TEXT_REGFSTEXPLORENOTE_00177_MILLITHIRONHEART_100_013","Kester's notes tend to be terse, and you may find them more difficult to follow than my own. Do not let that discourage you, however─if the vistas he has found are even half as magnificent as his tales make them out to be, it will be more than worth the effort to seek them out."
7,"TEXT_REGFSTEXPLORENOTE_00177_MILLITHIRONHEART_100_014","Well now, to think that you have also met Uncle Ulger! There is no hiding his passion for foreign lands and their cultures, and I've no doubt that such sights as he has noted in your log will be well worth the seeking."

11,"TEXT_REGFSTEXPLORENOTE_00177_MILLITHIRONHEART_000_021","From the first time we met, I could sense that we shared a certain bond. Why, I would not be surprised if you were a distant relative."
