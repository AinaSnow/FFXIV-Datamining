11,"TEXT_FESSUM2016GUIDE_00349_ETHELIA_000_012","However, they knew victory would be difficult to achieve on their own, and so they held the first ever Moonfire Faire to recruit other adventurers to their cause."
12,"TEXT_FESSUM2016GUIDE_00349_ETHELIA_000_013","It was a great success, and in the years that followed, the Cascadiers would continue to hold the faire in preparation for the Bombards' return.

Leading us to believe he was dead, the fiend has since been lying in wait, gathering his power, and has now returned to terrorize these lands once more."
16,"TEXT_FESSUM2016GUIDE_00349_ETHELIA_000_021","But he is mistaken if he thinks we shall be so easily cowed! No matter how many times he returns or how much stronger he grows, the Adventurers' Guild will always be here to send him back!"
17,"TEXT_FESSUM2016GUIDE_00349_ETHELIA_000_022","Yes, in fact, the Go Go Posing Rangers will see that the Bombard King is defeated once and for all, and the fiend shall sorely regret ever even thinking to infiltrate these lands!"
18,"TEXT_FESSUM2016GUIDE_00349_ETHELIA_000_023","However, he is not the only menace the Rangers must contend with, for he does not come alone. He has brought his minions with him and there are too many for even our resident heroes to take on without a little help."
