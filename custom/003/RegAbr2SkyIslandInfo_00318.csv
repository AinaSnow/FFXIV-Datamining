1,"TEXT_REGABR2SKYISLANDINFO_00318_MAUNIE_000_001","Hate havin' to attune again and again, but if you don't, well, best prepare for a hard landin'."
2,"TEXT_REGABR2SKYISLANDINFO_00318_SYSTEM_000_010","Aether currents in the Diadem are unstable and likely to change, making attunement necessary each time you visit the area."
3,"TEXT_REGABR2SKYISLANDINFO_00318_SYSTEM_000_011","Moreover, due to this turbulence, your aether compass will not function in the Diadem."
4,"TEXT_REGABR2SKYISLANDINFO_00318_SYSTEM_000_012","You can track your attunement progress with the duty list."
5,"TEXT_REGABR2SKYISLANDINFO_00318_BARNABAIX_110_000","Our ship, the <Emphasis>Bounty</Emphasis>, was torn apart by the winds of the Diadem. Though we survived the crash, others were not so fortunate...and in the days that followed, still others fell victim to the beasts which roam these isles."
6,"TEXT_REGABR2SKYISLANDINFO_00318_BARNABAIX_110_001","At the time, we thought we might have to spend the rest of our lives here, which is why we set about constructing this camp from the wreckage."
7,"TEXT_REGABR2SKYISLANDINFO_00318_BARNABAIX_110_002","These days, there's no shortage of travelers, be they adventurers or sky pirates. With their help, we've managed to transform this place into a proper outpost, where expeditions can rest and resupply─and retreat, should they find themselves overmatched."
8,"TEXT_REGABR2SKYISLANDINFO_00318_BARNABAIX_120_000","Out here, it's not how much you can pay, but how much you can contribute."
9,"TEXT_REGABR2SKYISLANDINFO_00318_BARNABAIX_120_001","...Least, that's how it used to be. As our outpost has grown, so too have our needs. Traders demand gil for their wares, and so we've got to find ways to raise funds, be it by selling scrap or what have you."
10,"TEXT_REGABR2SKYISLANDINFO_00318_BARNABAIX_120_002","It's gotten harder, and there's talk of heading back, but I won't. This is as much my home now, and I'm not about to abandon it...or the friends I buried here."
11,"TEXT_REGABR2SKYISLANDINFO_00318_BARNABAIX_130_000","We've lost more friends that I can count out here. To the beasts, to sickness, to starvation, to the bloody winds even."
12,"TEXT_REGABR2SKYISLANDINFO_00318_BARNABAIX_130_001","But we're still here. Through it all, we're still here."
13,"TEXT_REGABR2SKYISLANDINFO_00318_BARNABAIX_130_002","I tell you, there's nowhere else I'd rather be. And when I fall, they can bury me beside them."
14,"TEXT_REGABR2SKYISLANDINFO_00318_DENNIA_210_000","The thick clouds and swirling winds have kept these isles isolated from the outside world for ages. As a result, there are creatures here like none other."
15,"TEXT_REGABR2SKYISLANDINFO_00318_DENNIA_210_001","Some would have perished had they lived elsewhere, whereas others would have thrived─and slaughtered the competition."
16,"TEXT_REGABR2SKYISLANDINFO_00318_DENNIA_210_002","Ware these notorious monsters, for if you face them unprepared, then you will surely die."
17,"TEXT_REGABR2SKYISLANDINFO_00318_DENNIA_220_000","Many of the more fearsome beasts which inhabit these isles are nocturnal. As darkness falls, they begin to stir."
18,"TEXT_REGABR2SKYISLANDINFO_00318_DENNIA_220_001","Take care when exploring during these twilight hours. And, should you sense a foul presence, be warned─a notorious monster may be lurking nearby."
19,"TEXT_REGABR2SKYISLANDINFO_00318_DENNIA_230_000","Nights in the Diadem belong to the beasts. Do not think to wander as you can in the day."
20,"TEXT_REGABR2SKYISLANDINFO_00318_DENNIA_230_001","You would do well to watch the skies as well, for when the weather turns foul, unspeakable things emerge from their lairs."
21,"TEXT_REGABR2SKYISLANDINFO_00318_LYOLF_310_000","The beasts of the Diadem are a rather curious breed. Sometimes they hoard the possessions of the fallen, providing an unexpected boon after you slay them."
22,"TEXT_REGABR2SKYISLANDINFO_00318_LYOLF_310_001","You needn't go hunting to discover treasure, though. Some sky pirates have taken to burying their valuables, though I haven't the foggiest why anyone would go to the trouble."
23,"TEXT_REGABR2SKYISLANDINFO_00318_SYSTEM_310_010","Gold, silver, or bronze treasure coffers may appear upon the defeat of certain enemies or the completion of mission objectives."
24,"TEXT_REGABR2SKYISLANDINFO_00318_LYOLF_320_000","I nearly tripped over a buried coffer the other day. Whoever tried to hide it did a piss-poor job, 'cause the exposed metal caught the light of the sun and nearly blinded me."
25,"TEXT_REGABR2SKYISLANDINFO_00318_LYOLF_320_001","Seriously, though─why would anyone in their right mind bury their treasure? Why not use it to buy things? You know, things you like?"
26,"TEXT_REGABR2SKYISLANDINFO_00318_LYOLF_330_000","So I heard some sky pirates go so far as to booby-trap their coffers. Imagine that!"
27,"TEXT_REGABR2SKYISLANDINFO_00318_LYOLF_330_001","After a hard-fought battle, you settle down to reap the spoils, only to have the damn thing release a musk that'll draw every beast from malms around. Ruthless bastards. I swear, some folk will do anything to eliminate the competition."
28,"TEXT_REGABR2SKYISLANDINFO_00318_IOFA_410_000","The Diadem is quite rich in wind-aspected aether, which likely contributes to the instability of the aether currents, as well as other natural phenomena, such as the persistent whirlwinds you may discover."
29,"TEXT_REGABR2SKYISLANDINFO_00318_IOFA_410_001","I have observed whirlwinds so powerful that they can propel a man in full plate more than a hundred yalms, in fact."
30,"TEXT_REGABR2SKYISLANDINFO_00318_IOFA_410_002","Some adventurers have taken to using them as a means of transportation from isle to isle, from what I hear. Of course, I could never endorse such reckless behavior, for there is no way to know if a whirlwind will deliver you to another isle or naught at all."
31,"TEXT_REGABR2SKYISLANDINFO_00318_IOFA_420_000","If you happen to discover a pure white crystal in the Diadem, I advise you to attune with it. Such crystals are infused with aether that strengthens and invigorates the body."
32,"TEXT_REGABR2SKYISLANDINFO_00318_IOFA_420_001","Conversely, if the reports are accurate, you would do well to avoid pure black crystals. It seems such crystals have a detrimental effect on those who linger nearby, though you may be able to prevent this─or at least prevent others from being affected by it─should you attune with the crystal."
33,"TEXT_REGABR2SKYISLANDINFO_00318_IOFA_420_002","Both types of crystals appear to manifest all throughout the Diadem, so there is no telling where you might find them. Mayhap with more research I will be able to discern a pattern..."
34,"TEXT_REGABR2SKYISLANDINFO_00318_IOFA_430_000","Mayhap you have observed an atmospheric phenomena unique to the Diadem where the air practically crackles with lightning-aspected aether? We have dubbed this “hyperelectricity.”"
35,"TEXT_REGABR2SKYISLANDINFO_00318_IOFA_430_001","There appears to be a correlation between these conditions and the emergence of certain...extremely belligerent beasts. Proceed with the utmost caution if you choose to explore during such weather."
