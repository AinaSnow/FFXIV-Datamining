2,"TEXT_FESPDY2017SHARE_00377_BUTLER_000_002","I already pulled the Songbirds aside and explained to each of them that you would be the one making this most difficult decision. As such, I ask that you inform the girl of your choice directly. They would be much more thrilled to hear the news from you than me."
3,"TEXT_FESPDY2017SHARE_00377_BUTLER_000_003","With things drawing to a close, I can say with confidence that all the hurdles we encountered along the way have made this moment that much more special. This Little Ladies' Day will certainly be one to remember!"

7,"TEXT_FESPDY2017SHARE_00377_NARUMI_000_011","H-How do you think we did? The moment I stepped out on that stage, I was struck by such a terrible bout of nerves that my mind went completely blank! I hope I didn't make any mistakes!"
8,"TEXT_FESPDY2017SHARE_00377_MASHAMHAKARACCA_000_012","I couldn't be happier with these gorgeous costumes or the massive turnout! I can only hope the audience was just as pleased by our performance!"
9,"TEXT_FESPDY2017SHARE_00377_ULALA_000_020","No need for words, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>─I can already tell what you're thinking! You simply couldn't tear your eyes away from the stage, could you? Not that I can't blame you, of course! With me dancing center stage, not a single person could!"
10,"TEXT_FESPDY2017SHARE_00377_ULALA_000_021","This, however, is just the beginning! Soon people from all corners of the realm will flock to our stages to gaze upon their favorite new star!"

13,"TEXT_FESPDY2017SHARE_00377_MASHAMHAKARACCA_000_024","In the days and nights leading up to our big performance, I had been running all the steps and notes through my mind and, based upon the crowd's reaction, I daresay it paid off!"
14,"TEXT_FESPDY2017SHARE_00377_MASHAMHAKARACCA_000_025","Haha! I don't know what I was so worried for. They loved us, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>─and it's all thanks to you!"

20,"TEXT_FESPDY2017SHARE_00377_ADORINGFAN_000_040","Haha! I know you─you're a fellow fan. No need to be shy about it! I've seen you following the girls, going so far as to traverse the three city–states even to meet them. Tee hee hee! How do I know? Truth be told, I've been keeping an eye on them too!"
21,"TEXT_FESPDY2017SHARE_00377_ADORINGFAN_000_041","Seeing as you're a kindred soul, I'll let you in on a little secret. While we're all fans here, I'm their most devoted follower and, as such, have made it a point to go wherever they may go and note down their every word and gesture. Hehe!"
22,"TEXT_FESPDY2017SHARE_00377_ADORINGFAN_000_042","I've been a fan from before the Songbirds grew their wings and took to the skies! While most of their other followers love them for their success, I'm different. I love them for their courage and passion! They do everything they can to make the realm a more joyous place. Why, they even performed at the Starlight celebration last year for the orphans!"
23,"TEXT_FESPDY2017SHARE_00377_ADORINGFAN_000_050","You claim to be a fan of the Songbirds and yet you don't know the first thing about Little Ladies' Day!? For shame, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>madam<Else/>sir</If>! This simply won't do!"
24,"TEXT_FESPDY2017SHARE_00377_ADORINGFAN_000_051","Ahem. Little Ladies' Day is the one day a year we celebrate the young maidens that bring such joy to all reaches of the realm. This most wondrous of celebrations can be traced back three centuries past, to a time when the Thorne Dynasty still reigned in Ul'dah."
25,"TEXT_FESPDY2017SHARE_00377_ADORINGFAN_000_052","Princess Edvya, being the plucky young girl she was, grew disenchanted with palace life and decided one day to see what the other side of the castle walls had to offer. Finding the opportunity to do so by exchanging garb with a miller girl, she slipped off into the town in search of an adventure."
26,"TEXT_FESPDY2017SHARE_00377_ADORINGFAN_000_053","It didn't take long for the inhabitants of the palace to realize she had gone missing and upon learning of her disappearance, her father─Sultan Baldric Thorne─was stricken with panic. Summoning his entire guard, he ordered they find and return his precious daughter before any harm befell her─even if it meant tearing the city apart."
27,"TEXT_FESPDY2017SHARE_00377_ADORINGFAN_000_054","...And thus the city was torn apart, with the miller's house bearing the brunt of this terrible assault. The poor man whose daughter aided the princess's flight could do naught more than watch as they ripped his house to pieces and pelted his family with threats of imprisonment and worse."
28,"TEXT_FESPDY2017SHARE_00377_ADORINGFAN_000_055","To the good fortune of all, the princess was soon found just outside the palace walls and once she was safely returned to him did the sultan realize the grave mistake he had made. Ashamed and wishing to make amends, not only did he order that his finest craftsmen rebuild the miller's house from the ground up; he offered to make recompense by personally serving as seneschal to the miller girl for a day."
29,"TEXT_FESPDY2017SHARE_00377_ADORINGFAN_000_056","The smallfolk were deeply moved by this unforeseen display of humility and seeing that, Sultan Baldric─in a vow to never forget the lesson he learned that day─declared that each year he would serve as seneschal to a common girl who was to be chosen by the townsfolk by lot."
30,"TEXT_FESPDY2017SHARE_00377_ADORINGFAN_000_057","Even in his death, the tradition continued, living on as the Thorne Dynasty gave way to the House of Ul. In time, it spread to the other nations, where it grew in popularity and came to be the Little Ladies' Day festival that we all know and love today."
