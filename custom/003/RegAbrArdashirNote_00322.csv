12,"TEXT_REGABRARDASHIRNOTE_00322_ARDASHIRNOTE_011","(-The Study of Anima-)The soul houses the psyche and makes us who we are. Practitioners of the arcane are able to channel aether from within themselves into soulstones, creating a quasi-soul that can animate golems.

15,"TEXT_REGABRARDASHIRNOTE_00322_ARDASHIRNOTE_014","(-The Study of Anima-)My last hope lay with the Sharlayans and their knowledge of arcane sentries, which led me to Eorzea.

16,"TEXT_REGABRARDASHIRNOTE_00322_ARDASHIRNOTE_015","(-The Study of Anima-)After needlessly berating my plan to base new trials on Sharlayan theory, this Gerolt fellow proposed an ingenious idea: binding the aether-infused soulstone with a weapon in order to preserve the anima.

45,"TEXT_REGABRARDASHIRNOTE_00322_ARDASHIRNOTE_054","(-The Anima and Aetherial Conductivity-)Though Gerolt was confident in his ability to enhance the anima weapon, it was not without risk.

Much to my surprise, he had a solution."
