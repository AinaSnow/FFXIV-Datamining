7,"TEXT_FESNYR2017_00365_BIRDSERVER_000_002","Unfortunately, this year our celebrations have been received with far less enthusiasm than we'd hoped. But no matter! While the tori bugyo's initial efforts to raise their interest were to little avail, I suspect that our free mochi will soon have the citizens of Eorzea lining up by the dozen!"
8,"TEXT_FESNYR2017_00365_BIRDSERVER_000_003","Aha! You're the daring adventurer that offered to lend us a hand! Thanks to you the celebrations are off to a rousing start!"

10,"TEXT_FESNYR2017_00365_BIRDSERVER_000_010","In the lands from which I hail, the turning of the year is marked by the appointment of a totem animal. This year we see the cock rise to this position."
11,"TEXT_FESNYR2017_00365_BIRDSERVER_000_011","Unlike in the Far East, however, the coming of the new year in Eorzea is usually signaled by a change in captaincy of the heavens."
12,"TEXT_FESNYR2017_00365_BIRDSERVER_000_012","This Heavensturn will see the reins transferred from Thaliak, ruler of rivers and wisdom, to Rhalgr, the Destroyer. The gentle cock, alongside the god of destruction─a most fascinating pairing, wouldn't you say?"
13,"TEXT_FESNYR2017_00365_BIRDSERVER_000_020","Mochi─or rice cakes as they are better known in Eorzea─are made by pouring steaming bowls of rice into a mortar, near full to the brim, and then pounding the whole until it forms a thick white dough."
14,"TEXT_FESNYR2017_00365_BIRDSERVER_000_021","While our practitioners make the process look deceptively simple, to achieve the perfect balance of soft and sticky this dessert is renowned for requires great stamina and a good sense of rhythm to ensure the mochi becomes nice and supple."

17,"TEXT_FESNYR2017_00365_BIRDSERVER_100_002","While our tori bugyo has been doing his utmost to garner the citizens' interest, sadly his efforts have gone largely unnoticed. <sigh> Perhaps the people have, for whatever reason, taken offense to the fact this is the year of the cock─a beast which symbolizes luck and virility but has, thus far, only brought us misfortune and fatigue."
18,"TEXT_FESNYR2017_00365_BIRDSERVER_100_003","Thanks to you, our mission has been a great success! Those that would once turn up their nose and look the other way whenever we approached are now clamoring for second and third helpings of our rice cakes!"
19,"TEXT_FESNYR2017_00365_BIRDSERVER_100_004","Truly, 'tis nothing short of a miracle, my friend! Haha! I can only hope next year's celebrations live up to the expectations this one has set!"

You see, Heavensturn is a way of welcoming the new year, though its practice varies greatly from place to place and person to person."
21,"TEXT_FESNYR2017_00365_BIRDSERVER_100_011","For example, here in your lands the new year is marked by the reins changing hands in the heavens. In the Far East, however, we celebrate the advent of the new year by selecting a totem animal to oversee our festivities. "
22,"TEXT_FESNYR2017_00365_BIRDSERVER_100_012","In our lands, the cock will rear its head once again, whereas, in Eorzea, Rhalgr, breaker of worlds, will begin His rule in the heavens."
23,"TEXT_FESNYR2017_00365_BIRDSERVER_100_020","Mochi? Why, yes of course─it is a dessert made by pouring freshly steamed rice into a large mortar. This is then pounded down into a thick, sticky paste with a mallet. Simple enough, yes?"
24,"TEXT_FESNYR2017_00365_BIRDSERVER_100_021","But that's not all! The secret to good mochi is ensuring that both the mallet and the mortar are well lubricated before the pounding begins! Ah, I see the skepticism in your eyes, my friend. While it might sound trivial, I assure you this is the most crucial step in the whole process."

29,"TEXT_FESNYR2017_00365_BIRDSERVER_200_004","The festivities are still far from over, so I certainly hope you will continue to lend us your support.

31,"TEXT_FESNYR2017_00365_BIRDSERVER_200_011","It is my understanding that in the West, each year the rule of the heavens is passed down from the current commanding god or goddess to the next in the line of succession. This year Eorzea sees Rhalgr, the Destroyer ascend the throne."

Traditionally, rice is steeped in water overnight and steamed before being transferred to a mortar, where it is pounded down into a sticky dough with a wooden mallet."
34,"TEXT_FESNYR2017_00365_BIRDSERVER_200_021","While many people mistakenly concern themselves with the size and make of the mallet, they must realize that neither of these things is nearly as important as <Emphasis>how</Emphasis> the weapon is wielded."
