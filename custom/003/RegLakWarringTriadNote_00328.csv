7,"TEXT_REGLAKWARRINGTRIADNOTE_00328_TRIADLORE_000_010","(-The Warring Triad: The Awakening-)<Emphasis>The Warring Triad is the collective term for three immensely powerful eikons that were brought into existence during the twilight of the Third Astral Era. Summoned by the native tribes of Meracydia, these entities were set against the encroaching forces of the Allagan Empire.</Emphasis>"
8,"TEXT_REGLAKWARRINGTRIADNOTE_00328_TRIADLORE_000_011","(-The Warring Triad: The Awakening-)<Emphasis>The strength of a primal is determined by the fervent prayers of its faithful. And as the Meracydians' prayers called for saviors with the power to throw back an imperial invasion, the resulting incarnations were perforce imbued with nigh-incalculable might.</Emphasis>"
9,"TEXT_REGLAKWARRINGTRIADNOTE_00328_TRIADLORE_000_012","(-The Warring Triad: The Awakening-)<Emphasis>That the Allagans were capable of conquering such godlike beings well illustrates the incredible heights to which their technology had ascended. The implacable empire subdued and imprisoned the Warring Triad─shackled them to machinery that sustained the eikons' forms whilst at the same time leeching away their infinite energies.</Emphasis>"
10,"TEXT_REGLAKWARRINGTRIADNOTE_00328_TRIADLORE_000_013","(-The Warring Triad: The Awakening-)<Emphasis>For five millennia did the Warring Triad languish thus in dreaming servitude, their slumber undisturbed until Archbishop Thordan VII of Ishgard rattled the bars of their cage.</Emphasis>"
11,"TEXT_REGLAKWARRINGTRIADNOTE_00328_TRIADLORE_000_014","(-The Warring Triad: The Awakening-)<Emphasis>The archbishop had come to Azys Lla seeking to absorb the three's power and make of himself a god without rival. It was fortunate, then, that the Warrior of Light and <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> companions thwarted Thordan before he realized his tyrannical ambitions─but the victory was not without consequence.</Emphasis>"
12,"TEXT_REGLAKWARRINGTRIADNOTE_00328_TRIADLORE_000_015","(-The Warring Triad: The Awakening-)<Emphasis>The violence of the battle cracked the seals that keep the Triad in torpor, and the eikons have begun to stir. Worse, the Garlean Empire and their heavy-handed efforts to plunder the secrets of Azys Lla threaten to drag them into full wakefulness.
These terrible entities must be destroyed before they arise in all their cataclysmic splendor.</Emphasis>"
13,"TEXT_REGLAKWARRINGTRIADNOTE_00328_TRIADLORE_000_020","(-Chapter 1: Sephirot-)<Emphasis>The Warrior of Light has toppled the first of the Warring Triad.
We knew little of Sephirot other than that he was the chief deity of a tribe of treelike beings─a sacred tree ascended to godhood. Allagan histories discovered upon the event of his destruction, however, have brought fascinating new facts to light.</Emphasis>"
14,"TEXT_REGLAKWARRINGTRIADNOTE_00328_TRIADLORE_000_021","(-Chapter 1: Sephirot-)<Emphasis>These recordings attribute to Sephirot the ability to “induce spontaneous growth in living organisms through the manipulation of ambient aetheric energy.” It is noted that the eikon did not hesitate to direct this ability upon himself.</Emphasis>"
15,"TEXT_REGLAKWARRINGTRIADNOTE_00328_TRIADLORE_000_022","(-Chapter 1: Sephirot-)<Emphasis>Sephirot grew to gigantic proportions during his conflict with the armies of Allag, using his own colossal limbs to cut great swaths of devastation through their ranks. He was eventually overwhelmed, however, and his abilities contained.</Emphasis>"
16,"TEXT_REGLAKWARRINGTRIADNOTE_00328_TRIADLORE_000_023","(-Chapter 1: Sephirot-)<Emphasis>The Allagans performed experiments upon the captured eikon, siphoning his growth-inducing energies into the cultivation of numerous chimerical monstrosities─one unnatural existence propagating countless others.</Emphasis>"
17,"TEXT_REGLAKWARRINGTRIADNOTE_00328_TRIADLORE_000_024","(-Chapter 1: Sephirot-)<Emphasis>When one believes one's control unbreakable however, a single, overlooked flaw inevitably leads to catastrophe. I know of at least one civilization that collapsed under the weight of such hubris...</Emphasis>"
18,"TEXT_REGLAKWARRINGTRIADNOTE_00328_TRIADLORE_000_030","(-Chapter 2: A Persistent Foe-)<Emphasis>The Garlean Empire's VIth Legion has breached the core laboratories of Azys Lla's research facility. Seeking to prevent the imperials from extracting the Genesis Expression, the Warrior of Light and <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> allies pursued the legatus and his soldiers, and succeeded in denying him the vital formula.</Emphasis>"
19,"TEXT_REGLAKWARRINGTRIADNOTE_00328_TRIADLORE_000_031","(-Chapter 2: A Persistent Foe-)<Emphasis>The Garleans claim their interest in primal-harnessing technology comes from a desire to constrain the entities' wanton destruction. But while this purpose seems perfectly noble, such control would place the power of gods in the hands of a select group of men.</Emphasis>"
20,"TEXT_REGLAKWARRINGTRIADNOTE_00328_TRIADLORE_000_032","(-Chapter 2: A Persistent Foe-)<Emphasis>Who then might oppose the emperor should he wish to sunder the world? And what guarantee prevents error and happenstance from setting the primals free? Ever would the threat of their accidental awakening loom above our heads.</Emphasis>"
21,"TEXT_REGLAKWARRINGTRIADNOTE_00328_TRIADLORE_000_033","(-Chapter 2: A Persistent Foe-)<Emphasis>By “harnessing” a primal, one is also condensing and concentrating its vast energies. Upon the being's release, its long-suppressed power and simmering rancor explodes with unimaginable violence.</Emphasis>"
22,"TEXT_REGLAKWARRINGTRIADNOTE_00328_TRIADLORE_000_034","(-Chapter 2: A Persistent Foe-)<Emphasis>With their potency increased far beyond that of the typical beastman-summoned deity, the defeat of harnessed entities becomes exponentially more arduous. Such might can only be overcome with more might.</Emphasis>"
23,"TEXT_REGLAKWARRINGTRIADNOTE_00328_TRIADLORE_000_035","(-Chapter 2: A Persistent Foe-)<Emphasis>...But ultimately, the battle has no victor. When powers of this magnitude collide, they consume immense reservoirs of aether. The star will be drained of life before the clash can be decided, and all will crumble into oblivion.</Emphasis>"
24,"TEXT_REGLAKWARRINGTRIADNOTE_00328_TRIADLORE_000_040","(-Chapter 3: Sophia-)<Emphasis>The Goddess has fallen, and only one pillar of the Warring Triad remains. According to the records we discovered upon Sophia's destruction, the eikon had once schemed to bring the Allagan Empire to ruin from within.</Emphasis>"
25,"TEXT_REGLAKWARRINGTRIADNOTE_00328_TRIADLORE_000_041","(-Chapter 3: Sophia-)<Emphasis>The histories also spoke of her followers, and how they perceived the ever-expanding imperials as anathema to the world's balance.</Emphasis>"
26,"TEXT_REGLAKWARRINGTRIADNOTE_00328_TRIADLORE_000_042","(-Chapter 3: Sophia-)<Emphasis>Equilibrium is Sophia's domain. Her worshipers saw the righting of the scales as their sacred duty, and thus did they resist the Allagans' invasion with holy fervor. Never mind that the summoning of an eikon did upset their precious balance all the more.</Emphasis>"
27,"TEXT_REGLAKWARRINGTRIADNOTE_00328_TRIADLORE_000_043","(-Chapter 3: Sophia-)<Emphasis>The concept of balance is, however, of great interest to my master. A world must have both Light and Darkness, and a sudden surge of either will endanger its very existence.</Emphasis>"
28,"TEXT_REGLAKWARRINGTRIADNOTE_00328_TRIADLORE_000_044","(-Chapter 3: Sophia-)<Emphasis>Upon our first meeting, my master spoke thus: I am not the Light's servant, but for the present I must serve. One cannot arbitrate equilibrium if one is not fluid of stance.</Emphasis>"
29,"TEXT_REGLAKWARRINGTRIADNOTE_00328_TRIADLORE_000_045","(-Chapter 3: Sophia-)<Emphasis>The tenets of our justice are found not in Light nor Darkness nor the grey shades in between. We but seek to enforce that which prevents the visitation of oblivion. To moderate the endless waves of war such that neither side claims victory...that is our charge.</Emphasis>"
30,"TEXT_REGLAKWARRINGTRIADNOTE_00328_TRIADLORE_000_050","(-Chapter 4: Zurvan-)<Emphasis>The followers of Zurvan were broken from their slumber─likely the doing of Sophia's worshipers─and immediately began attempting to rouse their master in the fullness of his power. We found ourselves in an unexpected alliance with the forces of the VIth Legion, and rushed inside the research facility to put a stop to the thralls' ambitions.</Emphasis>"
31,"TEXT_REGLAKWARRINGTRIADNOTE_00328_TRIADLORE_000_051","(-Chapter 4: Zurvan-)<Emphasis>Although we succeeded in this initial endeavor, the effort cost the lives of many imperial soldiers, including that of Regula van Hydrus himself. Seizing the opportunity their sacrifice bought for us, the Warrior of Light led a company of echo-blessed champions against the half-woken Demon, and cast down the final pillar of the Warring Triad.</Emphasis>"
32,"TEXT_REGLAKWARRINGTRIADNOTE_00328_TRIADLORE_000_052","(-Chapter 4: Zurvan-)<Emphasis>Upon discovering the flaws apparent in the Allagans' technology, the legatus chose to abandon its acquisition, and looked to recruit the aid of the Scions with nary a moment's hesitation. His was a decision motivated not by glory, but by loyalty to his emperor. Above all, he strove to enforce the will of his childhood friend, and ensure that the primal threat hanging over this star would be eradicated.</Emphasis>"
33,"TEXT_REGLAKWARRINGTRIADNOTE_00328_TRIADLORE_000_053","(-Chapter 4: Zurvan-)<Emphasis>Over the course of our quest to eliminate the Warring Triad, the meddling of the Garlean Empire has been our greatest obstacle. That an officer so lofty within its ranks should recognize the danger and make such a rational choice is a significant development in our war against the primals.</Emphasis>"
34,"TEXT_REGLAKWARRINGTRIADNOTE_00328_TRIADLORE_000_054","(-Chapter 4: Zurvan-)<Emphasis>Ere the star upon which I was born became the void, the champions who lived upon it chose to embrace self-destruction rather than cease their infernal conflict. They became lost within their own ambitions, strangling the life from one another even as the flood of Darkness swallowed them whole...</Emphasis>"
35,"TEXT_REGLAKWARRINGTRIADNOTE_00328_TRIADLORE_000_055","(-Chapter 4: Zurvan-)<Emphasis>Here on Hydaelyn, the power of Light is not so feeble. This world will survive while the balance holds, but we must also take care that the scales do not swing too far in Light's favor.</Emphasis>"
36,"TEXT_REGLAKWARRINGTRIADNOTE_00328_TRIADLORE_000_056","(-Chapter 4: Zurvan-)<Emphasis>As we fight on the side of Light, we must trust that our companions will steer us away from the lure of extremity, and help guide us along the narrow path to salvation. It is the actions of men such as Regula van Hydrus that give me hope that the future of this star is not beyond redemption.</Emphasis>"
