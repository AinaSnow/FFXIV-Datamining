6,"TEXT_REGDRA2MOGZIN_00360_MOGZIN_000_011","We have a long road ahead of us, but there's no harder working group of crafters in all of Moghome, kupo!"
7,"TEXT_REGDRA2MOGZIN_00360_MOGZIN_000_012","We obviously still have much to learn, but I'm sure with your help even Chieftain Moglin will be impressed with our skills!"

10,"TEXT_REGDRA2MOGZIN_00360_MOGZIN_000_022","Although repair of the plaza is sure to be a massive undertaking, the lessons we learn along the way will certainly help us in the future. And so we will work day and night to restore Bahrr Lehs to its former glory!"

17,"TEXT_REGDRA2MOGZIN_00360_MOGZIN_000_111","Everyone has their part to play in rebuilding the statue demanded by Gullinbursti─even you! We can't waste any time with idle chatter!"

20,"TEXT_REGDRA2MOGZIN_00360_MOGZIN_000_122","To think the plaza has changed so much since then. Of course, we wouldn't have been able to do it without your support! I have a feeling we're nearing the end of our work here, and after that we'll move to Zenith proper!"
21,"TEXT_REGDRA2MOGZIN_00360_MOGZIN_000_150","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, these new tools are amazing, kupo! It's hard to imagine how we got along without them! Do you need anything? Make it quick─I can't wait to get back to building!"

27,"TEXT_REGDRA2MOGZIN_00360_MOGZIN_000_161","To think all of our worries were solved so easily. We would have never thought it was our tools that were the cause. Perhaps in time, we'll be able to make even better ones!"
28,"TEXT_REGDRA2MOGZIN_00360_MOGZIN_000_162","For now, we must focus our efforts on the task at hand─Gullinbursti's statue! Come on, we all have our work to do!"

34,"TEXT_REGDRA2MOGZIN_00360_MOGZIN_000_210","Is this some kind of test, kupo? I'm Mogzin, master of the Mogmenders. We've just completed our first official commission: Gullinbursti's statue."
35,"TEXT_REGDRA2MOGZIN_00360_MOGZIN_000_211","Of course, everyone is taking a well-deserved rest. But I can't stop thinking that something was off about Gullinbursti's reaction. Perhaps I'm just imagining things..."

My only complaint is that Ohl Deeh's constant roaring has left me with a terrible headache. You don't think you could talk to him about that, could you?"
52,"TEXT_REGDRA2MOGZIN_00360_MOGZIN_000_411","More importantly, the restoration of Zenith is well-nigh complete, kupo! And needless to say, we couldn't have done it without the knowledge and aid of our new friends, the Vath and the Gundu. Just you wait for it, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>─we'll show our thanks by building something that will have the whole realm standing in awe and astonishment!"
