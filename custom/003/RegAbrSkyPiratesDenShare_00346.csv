1,"TEXT_REGABRSKYPIRATESDENSHARE_00346_REDBILLDECKHAND_000_010","Here to see the captain? Just go through the gate here, and head north when you come out up top─his quarters are across the bridge."
2,"TEXT_REGABRSKYPIRATESDENSHARE_00346_REDBILLDECKHAND_000_020","Thought I'd have to bloody my little fang here, but it seems those lads ain't lookin' for a fight. I s'pose I'll just follow Leofard's lead on this one..."
3,"TEXT_REGABRSKYPIRATESDENSHARE_00346_REDBILLDECKHAND_000_030","Is it true that Radlia's disbanded the Talons? I mean, it ain't as if we were mates or nothin', but the skies'll seem a little emptier without 'em."
4,"TEXT_REGABRSKYPIRATESDENSHARE_00346_REDBILLDECKHAND_100_000","Those damned demons think they can just fly in and start smashin' up the place? We'll show them not to mess with the Redbills..."
5,"TEXT_REGABRSKYPIRATESDENSHARE_00346_REDBILLDECKHAND_100_010","I told you we'd take care of them fiends! We ought to crack open a few casks and celebrate!"
6,"TEXT_REGABRSKYPIRATESDENSHARE_00346_REDBILLDECKHAND_100_020","I ain't never seen anyone able to rile up the captain quite so much as that little Cait Sith. It's a bloody talent, I tell you!"
7,"TEXT_REGABRSKYPIRATESDENSHARE_00346_REDBILLENGINEER_000_100","When you're a sky pirate, a well-maintained airship can mean the difference between life and a horrible, plummetin' death. So, aye, we keep a damn close eye on the condition of our vessels around here."
8,"TEXT_REGABRSKYPIRATESDENSHARE_00346_REDBILLENGINEER_000_110","They better not start any trouble around the airships. I just finished realigning the propellers..."
9,"TEXT_REGABRSKYPIRATESDENSHARE_00346_REDBILLENGINEER_100_100","Aye, well, our ships survived without a scratch, but I'm afraid I can't say the same for the crew. That bastard better get what's coming to him."
10,"TEXT_REGABRSKYPIRATESDENSHARE_00346_REDBILLENGINEER_100_110","It's a damn shame what happened to the <Emphasis>Raimille</Emphasis>, but I'm glad to see the captain made it back in one piece. There're some things even me and my wrench can't fix!"
11,"TEXT_REGABRSKYPIRATESDENSHARE_00346_REDBILLENGINEER_100_120","I was in Idyllshire a while ago to trade, and got to talking with one of the goblin merchants. When I mentioned your adventures with the captain, he was excited to know all about you─even gave me a discount!"
12,"TEXT_REGABRSKYPIRATESDENSHARE_00346_REDBILLCOOK_000_200","When the crew's heads are filled with naught but loot and laughter, it's my job to see their bellies are filled with decent grub. That Leofard's the worst of the lot─he'd live on gold bars and boot leather if I wasn't here to cook for him!"
13,"TEXT_REGABRSKYPIRATESDENSHARE_00346_REDBILLCOOK_100_200","I hear the captain's up to his usual tricks─ignorin' sound advice and riskin' certain death and all that. He might have saved the sky from a voidsent invasion, but poor Stacia's goin' to lose her mind if he keeps on like this..."
14,"TEXT_REGABRSKYPIRATESDENSHARE_00346_REDBILLCOOK_100_210","As punishment for sneakin' out of his sickbed, we put the captain on the roster for deckhand duties. He was meant to take a turn at the watch, do the laundry, check the sailcloth, and swab the floors...and managed to wriggle out of every single one of them."

16,"TEXT_REGABRSKYPIRATESDENSHARE_00346_LEOFARD_100_300","There ain't been much excitement to speak of since we last flew together. Aye, the dull periods make the adventures that much more enjoyable, but I can feel more of me skills fadin' away the longer I sit idle..."
17,"TEXT_REGABRSKYPIRATESDENSHARE_00346_STACIA_000_400","Cait Sith has his furry little head buried in that book, learnin' as much as he can about the Nullstone. I think I'll use this time to do some studyin' of my own─“know thine enemy,” and all that."
18,"TEXT_REGABRSKYPIRATESDENSHARE_00346_STACIA_100_400","I hear the Talons are off pillagin' some uncharted reach of the heavens. We'll have to put on our treasure-huntin' hats if we're to stay ahead of Radlia─can't let them have all the fun!"
19,"TEXT_REGABRSKYPIRATESDENSHARE_00346_CAITSITH_000_500","The world is as beautiful as it ever was. And I will not let this realm, beloved of my master, be tainted by rampaging voidsent.

20,"TEXT_REGABRSKYPIRATESDENSHARE_00346_CAITSITH_100_500","Did you know that Leofard hoards all the gold and gaudy trinkets from his escapades, but simply sells the precious scrolls and tomes to the highest bidder!? The man has no concept of true value!"
21,"TEXT_REGABRSKYPIRATESDENSHARE_00346_UTATA_000_600","There's no grander feeling than flitting about in the air to test some tweak or adjustment I've made to an airship. The thought of some horde of horrid demons infesting those same skies is just too terrible to contemplate!"
22,"TEXT_REGABRSKYPIRATESDENSHARE_00346_UTATA_100_605","I hope you don't think I let the captain leave his sickbed without so much as a word of protest. I turned my back for a moment and he was just...gone!"
