14,"TEXT_FESPDY2016RECOLLECTION_00323_ULALA_000_052","We may be invisible now, Narumi, but give it a bit more time. Soon the crowds will be chanting “Ooh la la, Ulala.” After that, we'll be able to forget we ever even had need for flyers!"
15,"TEXT_FESPDY2016RECOLLECTION_00323_MASHAMHAKARACCA_000_053","Ulala's got it <Emphasis>mostly</Emphasis> right. We cannot allow a few dismissive shrugs and smiles to deter us. Fear not, Narumi. We shall conquer Ul'dah, one fan at a time, if that's what it takes!"

Sadly, while people seem to be a lot more willing to accept and even read through our flyers, we've found that they still hesitate to come to our shows."
19,"TEXT_FESPDY2016RECOLLECTION_00323_NARUMI_000_061","Maybe handing out flyers and sweets alone is not enough to attract a crowd. We've been focusing so hard on making people take our handouts that we've neglected to practice our singing and dancing."
20,"TEXT_FESPDY2016RECOLLECTION_00323_ULALA_000_062","Oooh, don't tell me you want to do that <Emphasis>now</Emphasis>. My bones creak with exhaustion even as we speak. Can't we do that after I've taken a nice long rest?"
21,"TEXT_FESPDY2016RECOLLECTION_00323_MASHAMHAKARACCA_000_063","Giving up already, Ulala? What happened to wanting to become Eorzea's number one songstress?"

23,"TEXT_FESPDY2016RECOLLECTION_00323_ULALA_000_070","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! How was it? Things could certainly have gone better for us. <sniff> It would seem even my charm has its limits."
24,"TEXT_FESPDY2016RECOLLECTION_00323_MASHAMHAKARACCA_000_071","Yes, it was quite disappointing. Despite managing to gather together a small crowd, not a single person remained for longer than a few moments. I fear that mayhap even the average street performers of Ul'dah surpass us in skill."
25,"TEXT_FESPDY2016RECOLLECTION_00323_NARUMI_000_072","I–It's true, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I–I'm so afraid we'll end up naught but failures, left to wither away on the streets with the peach blossoms at festival's end."
26,"TEXT_FESPDY2016RECOLLECTION_00323_ULALA_000_073","Well, all this whining certainly isn't going to accomplish anything! If you two have time to mope, then you should also have the time to pick yourselves back up, look to the skies, and reach for the stars!"
27,"TEXT_FESPDY2016RECOLLECTION_00323_MASHAMHAKARACCA_000_074","<sigh> While Ulala should be the last person to accuse anyone of whining, she is once again, correct. So long as we practice, practice, and practice some more, there is no obstacle too great!"

29,"TEXT_FESPDY2016RECOLLECTION_00323_NARUMI_000_081","Oh, yes! I've seen it too! Our flyers appear to be doing the trick!"
30,"TEXT_FESPDY2016RECOLLECTION_00323_ULALA_000_082","Ha ha ha! And no doubt the song-starved masses, captivated by my boundless charm, will keep coming back for more!"
31,"TEXT_FESPDY2016RECOLLECTION_00323_MASHAMHAKARACCA_000_083","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, our newfound success has even convinced the royal seneschal to buy us new costumes!

35,"TEXT_FESPDY2016RECOLLECTION_00323_ULALA_000_092","You should have seen the wild look in the eyes of some of the girls that came to our last few performances. Like spriggans transfixed by the most exquisite of gems, they simply couldn't tear their gaze away from me!"

54,"TEXT_FESPDY2016RECOLLECTION_00323_ADORINGFAN_000_101","Ahem. Little Ladies' Day is the one day a year we celebrate the young maidens that bring such joy to our lands in a tradition that can be traced back to the events of some three centuries past, when the Thorne Dynasty still reigned in Ul'dah."
55,"TEXT_FESPDY2016RECOLLECTION_00323_ADORINGFAN_000_102","The plucky Princess Edvya, disenchanted with palace life, decided it time to see what the other side of the castle walls had to offer. One day seeing her opportunity to do so, she exchanged garb with a miller girl and slipped off into town in search of adventure."
56,"TEXT_FESPDY2016RECOLLECTION_00323_ADORINGFAN_000_103","It didn't take long for the palace to realize something was amiss and upon learning of her disappearance, her father─Sultan Baldric Thorne─was stricken with panic. He summoned his entire standing army, ordering they tear the city apart and find her before any harm befell his precious daughter."
57,"TEXT_FESPDY2016RECOLLECTION_00323_ADORINGFAN_000_104","...And tear apart the city they did, starting with the miller's house. The poor man whose daughter aided the princess's escape could do naught but watch as his house was ripped to pieces and his family was pelted with threats of imprisonment and worse."
58,"TEXT_FESPDY2016RECOLLECTION_00323_ADORINGFAN_000_105","To the good fortune of all, Princess Edvya was soon found just outside the palace walls. Only once she was safely returned to him did the sultan realize he had gone too far. He had the miller's house rebuilt by his finest craftsmen and, in an attempt to atone for his actions, offered to personally serve as seneschal to the miller girl for a day."
59,"TEXT_FESPDY2016RECOLLECTION_00323_ADORINGFAN_000_106","In seeing how deeply moved the smallfolk were by this unforeseen display of humility, Sultan Baldric─in a vow to never forget the lessons he learned that day─declared that each year he would serve as seneschal to a common girl who was to be chosen by the townsfolk by lot."
60,"TEXT_FESPDY2016RECOLLECTION_00323_ADORINGFAN_000_107","This tradition continued long after Sultan Baldric's death, living on even as the Thorne Dynasty gave way to the Ul. In time, it spread to other nations, where it took on new forms, eventually evolving into the Little Ladies' Day celebration that we know and love today."
