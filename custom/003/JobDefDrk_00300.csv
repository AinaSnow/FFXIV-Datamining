3,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_Q1_000_050","What will you ask?"
4,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_A1_000_051","Tell me about yourself."
5,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_A1_000_052","What is a dark knight?"
6,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_A1_000_053","Nothing."
7,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_SIDURGU_000_060","...There is rather little to tell."
8,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_SIDURGU_000_061","My master was an accomplished dark knight who saved countless lives─including mine own."
9,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_SIDURGU_000_062","I owed him my life, and so I pledged it to his cause. I begged him to teach me the dark arts, and he agreed, making me his first pupil. Fray would become the second shortly thereafter."
10,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_SIDURGU_000_063","Heh, how different we were. I recall our master once likened me to a smoldering campfire and Fray to a frozen lake."
11,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_SIDURGU_000_064","...We knew the risks. We swore that we would have no regrets. And I...I have none."
12,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_SIDURGU_000_065","All that remains is to finish what we started."
13,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_SIDURGU_000_070","Recall the story of the first, who was that rarest of knights─one who held his vows sacrosanct and strove ever to walk in the Fury's grace."
14,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_SIDURGU_000_071","This man good and true did what no one else had the courage to do. He passed judgment on a vile beast who had used his position in the clergy to commit unspeakable crimes."
15,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_SIDURGU_000_072","To wit, he cut down the clergyman before the eyes of gods and men, ensuring that the bastard would never harm another child of the Brume again."
16,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_SIDURGU_000_073","The Holy See could not abide such action, of course. He was detained and delivered unto the Tribunal. Though he won his freedom through trial by combat, he was later stripped of his titles and denounced for his deeds."
17,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_SIDURGU_000_074","But rather than lament his poor fortune, he embraced it. If they would condemn him as a dark knight, then he would take it as a title."
18,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_SIDURGU_000_075","He forsook the trappings of his past life, including his sigil and the shield which bore it. In its place, he came to wield something far more potent: a power born of the abyss which lies at the heart of us all."
19,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_SIDURGU_000_076","A darkness which can grant us great strength...at a price."
20,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_SIDURGU_000_100","You look to be in good health, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Something we can do for you?"
21,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_SIDURGU_000_101","Oh, don't you worry about me. I'll be right as rain soon enough. Ugh...
Was there something you wanted to discuss?"
22,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_SIDURGU_000_102","Trouble seems to follow you wherever you go, doesn't it? And when it doesn't, you can't help but conjure it up... Anyway, how goes it?"
23,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_SIDURGU_000_103","Saved any more parallel worlds lately? I jest, I jest. Still, you can't blame a man for viewing such incredible claims with a measure of skepticism, can you?"
24,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_Q2_000_150","What will you ask?"
25,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_A2_000_151","How fare you and Rielle?"

30,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_A3_000_156","Tell me again about Fray."
31,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_SIDURGU_000_160","It would seem that the countess's crusade died with her. No one has sought us out since that day."
32,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_SIDURGU_000_161","Even so, I do not expect these peaceful days to last. So long as there are those who prey on the weak and helpless, there will ever be a need for knights such as we."
33,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_SIDURGU_000_162","But I worry for Rielle. I cannot abandon her, yet I would not have her be a party to what will come..."

35,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_SIDURGU_000_164","...Her life is her own, to make with it what she will. If that is her desire...then we shall discuss it."
36,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_SIDURGU_000_170","I should think you know as well as I─perhaps even better. Nevertheless, if you wish to hear the tale once more, I will oblige."

42,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_SIDURGU_000_176","I once thought I understood this power. But then I met a band of singing moogles, and...well, I wouldn't say I'm <Emphasis>conflicted</Emphasis>. I'm rather certain that I have a greater understanding of the darkness within than some furry little shites. Still, I...I'm not quite sure what to think."
43,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_SIDURGU_000_180","I try not to think about that strange boy and whatever he might have been. No one truly understands the nature of soul crystals. Not just ours, mind─I heard a rumor once upon a time about paladins and “establishing dominance.” Bollocks, eh?"
44,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_SIDURGU_000_181","Anyway, the one thing we know for certain is that the beings he conjured with his magick were not the spirits of the dead, but simulacra born from the memories of the living."
45,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_SIDURGU_000_182","A memory is hardly a perfect accounting of past events and people. Be it consciously or subconsciously, our perceptions and feelings distort the truth."
46,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_SIDURGU_000_183","Take that woman, the cousin of Ser Ignasse. She wanted to make him proud, and so he praised her efforts. Lowdy's husband and Gallien's friend were similarly shaped by the desires within their own hearts..."
47,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_SIDURGU_000_184","...And no, I would rather not discuss the implications of my master soundly defeating me, yet somehow letting you win."
48,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_SIDURGU_000_185","The point is, those shades spoke not the words of the dead, but the truth of our own hearts. What we bore witness to were conversations with one's self."
49,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_SIDURGU_000_186","At least, that's what I'm inclined to believe. But like I said, who knows? Soul crystals are strange little things. Perhaps it's best not to dig too deep."
50,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_SIDURGU_000_190","Keen to take a stroll down memory lane? I'm not sure what's prompting this, but if you insist..."
51,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_SIDURGU_000_191","Fray was the second pupil Ser Ompagne took after me. In our master's words, I was the smoldering campfire, whereas Fray was the frozen lake."
52,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_SIDURGU_000_192","He had an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, and pursued the study of conjury in addition to our dark arts. It is well he did, for otherwise he might not have been able to sense Rielle's potential and train her as a healer."
53,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_SIDURGU_000_193","""Why conjury, of all things?“ I once asked him that..."
54,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_SIDURGU_000_194","Fray shrugged and smiled in that way of his, and said, “When you're coming apart at the seams, who else will make you whole again?”"
55,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRK_00300_SIDURGU_000_195","That was who he was to me. Who he was to you, though... Well. You'd know better than me."
