1,"TEXT_FESXMS2016GUIDE_00366_Q1_000_001","What will you ask?"
2,"TEXT_FESXMS2016GUIDE_00366_A1_000_001","What is the Starlight Celebration?"
3,"TEXT_FESXMS2016GUIDE_00366_A1_000_002","What's your task in all this?"
4,"TEXT_FESXMS2016GUIDE_00366_A1_000_003","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_FESXMS2016GUIDE_00366_GUIDEXMS2016_000_010","The Starlight Celebration can be traced back to ancient Ishgard. Long ago, a terrible battle claimed countless lives, leaving thousands of children orphaned in the harsh cold weather of Coerthas."
6,"TEXT_FESXMS2016GUIDE_00366_GUIDEXMS2016_000_011","Unable to bear their suffering, Ishgardian knights would offer these children board and lodging within their barracks. Of course, this was expressly forbidden, but the knights devised a plan to sneak them in, disguising the children in jackets of their scarlet uniforms."
7,"TEXT_FESXMS2016GUIDE_00366_GUIDEXMS2016_000_012","Owing to their generosity, the children survived the winter and lived to pay forward the kindness they had received. The former orphans would adorn themselves in scarlet uniforms, delivering gifts to children on the coldest week of the year. Thus, the Starlight Celebration was born."
8,"TEXT_FESXMS2016GUIDE_00366_GUIDEXMS2016_000_013","Over the years, the celebration has undergone gradual changes. The snowy-bearded captain of the kind-hearted knights has become known as the “Saint of Nymeia,” and children believe that he delivers their hopes and prayers directly to the goddess Herself."
9,"TEXT_FESXMS2016GUIDE_00366_GUIDEXMS2016_000_014","Similarly, his red-jacketed knights have become the “saint's little helpers.” They are particularly beloved by the younglings, for it is their role to bring gifts to every child who sends a prayer to the Spinner."
10,"TEXT_FESXMS2016GUIDE_00366_GUIDEXMS2016_000_020","My scarlet-clad colleagues and I have been charged by the Adventurers' Guild with running the Starlight Celebration. The festival spans the entire realm of Eorzea, and we have little helpers stationed in the cities of Gridania, Limsa Lominsa, and Ul'dah."
11,"TEXT_FESXMS2016GUIDE_00366_GUIDEXMS2016_000_021","This year, in cooperation with Frondale's Phrontistery, we have arranged for a special Starlight surprise for the brave young boys and girls battling illness and malaise in the children's ward."
12,"TEXT_FESXMS2016GUIDE_00366_GUIDEXMS2016_000_022","Should you have the time and inclination to lend us your aid, I can promise you your efforts would go far in bringing smiles to their faces."
13,"TEXT_FESXMS2016GUIDE_00366_AMHGARANJY_000_030","Happy Starlight, friend! I trust you are enjoying the festivities? I'd love to chat, but I'm preparing a very special delivery for the children's ward at Frondale's Phrontistery."
14,"TEXT_FESXMS2016GUIDE_00366_AMHGARANJY_000_040","Have you had any luck finding our missing goods, friend? I simply could not bear to see the faces of the children if the Spinner were to forsake them in this season of joy..."
15,"TEXT_FESXMS2016GUIDE_00366_AMHGARANJY_000_050","You've found the missing presents? Praise the Twelve! Why, the mere thought of seeing tears well in the eyes of those poor children nigh rent my heart in two. Might I trouble you to make the delivery to Frondale's Phrontistery? I would do it myself, but my duties demand I remain at my post..."
16,"TEXT_FESXMS2016GUIDE_00366_AMHGARANJY_000_060","You have our gratitude, friend. Thanks to your kindness, the boys and girls at the ward may forget their suffering for a day. If you are seeking a respite from your adventures, I encourage you to visit the Phrontistery and take part in the festivities. The children would be ever grateful, I am certain."
