Might you be interested in learning about the Hatching–tide festivities?"
1,"TEXT_FESEST2017_00380_EGGHUNTINGSTAFFA_000_010","A fledgling festival, Hatching–tide was born of a prophetic dream visited upon a Gridanian maiden named Jihli Aliapoh. In her dream, the Twelve Archons of old appeared, those heroes who saved the realm from the destruction of the Sixth Umbral Calamity."
2,"TEXT_FESEST2017_00380_EGGHUNTINGSTAFFA_000_011","Descending from the heavens atop beautifully decorated eggs, they said to Jihli, “Arise, young Dreamer, and make ready the vessels for our return.” And so she did─painstakingly painting and gilding eggs to match those from her vision."
3,"TEXT_FESEST2017_00380_EGGHUNTINGSTAFFA_000_012","Word of the prophecy spread, and Jihli attracted helpers to assist in her toils. After the Calamity, the festival grew further, as townsfolk and adventurers flocked to celebrate the Archons of yore, who many believe had some hand in delivering the realm once again."
