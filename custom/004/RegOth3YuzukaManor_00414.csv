5,"TEXT_REGOTH3YUZUKAMANOR_00414_GYOSAN_000_010","Well, as I just said, I am Gyosan the Namazu. I welcome you and others like you to Yuzuka Manor, and act as your guide while you are here."
6,"TEXT_REGOTH3YUZUKAMANOR_00414_GYOSAN_000_011","There is always a lot to explain, especially on a person's first visit. I guess you could say I am the face of this place to the outside world. And of that I am very proud. Very honored, very pleased."

8,"TEXT_REGOTH3YUZUKAMANOR_00414_GYOSAN_000_021","The Yuzuka clan was unmatched in their skill with firearms. When the Garleans attacked, it was the Yuzuka who led a troop of warriors against them, armed with the firearms of their forges. They fought valiantly. Yes, yes."
9,"TEXT_REGOTH3YUZUKAMANOR_00414_GYOSAN_000_022","In the end Garlemald prevailed, and the Yuzuka clan fell under their rule. They saw many difficult days. Very hard, very trying. But they never relented. In time, they rose up together with their lord and fought back again. <sigh> Sadly, they lost again, and this time their clan was disbanded."
