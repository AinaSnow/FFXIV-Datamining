Some of us catch the smaller fish with rods, while others use harpoons or nets to reel in the big ones. I, myself, use my hands and dive to collect shellfish from the seabed."

11,"TEXT_REGOTH3ISARI_00410_INUOI_000_023","If you are not a very good fisher, however, that might be a different story. Without some aptitude, not only will your hauls be meager, but you will also probably find yourself with very few friends."
