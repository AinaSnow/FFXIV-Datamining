1,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTKRILEINIT_00460_EJIKATSUNJIKA_000_001","Aye. I hate to admit it, but you had the right of it..."
2,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTKRILEINIT_00460_KRILE_000_002","I said I would tell you everything if my suspicions proved true, and so I will. The reason I urged the Scions to approve my participation in this expedition..."

4,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTKRILEINIT_00460_KRILE_100_003","The selfsame island that once served as the headquarters and home of the Students of Baldesion. An island that belongs on the other side of the world, that was obliterated by a terrible magick..."
5,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTKRILEINIT_00460_EJIKATSUNJIKA_000_004","I was fortunate to have been elsewhere at the time, but I know you were not so lucky. I don't suppose you have any idea how it could have ended up here in the Glass Ocean?"
6,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTKRILEINIT_00460_KRILE_000_005","Alas, my memories of the incident are muddled. All I recall is a voice─that of the star, I suspect. Faint and fleeting, but warm...and then I awoke on the shore of Old Sharlayan."
7,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTKRILEINIT_00460_EJIKATSUNJIKA_000_006","How convenient for you and utterly unhelpful for the rest of us. Would that more than Galuf's chosen heir could have received this “blessing” of Light."
8,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTKRILEINIT_00460_KRILE_000_007","And where are you off to now, Ejika?"
9,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTKRILEINIT_00460_EJIKATSUNJIKA_000_008","To find anyone else that might still be alive. I'll thank you not to follow─I work better alone."

11,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTKRILEINIT_00460_A1_000_001","Cutting us loose now that you got what you wanted?"
12,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTKRILEINIT_00460_A1_000_002","It'd be better for everyone if we cooperated."
13,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTKRILEINIT_00460_EJIKATSUNJIKA_000_009","...Hmph. I'll allow that I've yet to repay you for bringing me to this island. Let no one here say I am ungrateful─I heard it enough from Galuf..."

20,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTKRILEINIT_00460_KRILE_000_015","I appreciate your help more than you know."
21,"TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTKRILEINIT_00460_KRILE_000_016","But before you can begin in earnest, it is important that you are properly prepared. The stories you heard about the creatures that roam these lands were not exaggerations, and I would not see you struck down due to carelessness."
