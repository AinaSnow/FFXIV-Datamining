1,"TEXT_REGLAKGUIDINGSTAR_00246_TALK_A1","About master recipe tomes."
2,"TEXT_REGLAKGUIDINGSTAR_00246_TALK_A2","About artisan's & forager's gear."
3,"TEXT_REGLAKGUIDINGSTAR_00246_TALK_A3","About supra tools."
4,"TEXT_REGLAKGUIDINGSTAR_00246_TALK_A4","About lucis tools."
5,"TEXT_REGLAKGUIDINGSTAR_00246_TALK_A5","Nothing."
6,"TEXT_REGLAKGUIDINGSTAR_00246_TALK_A1_1","As you may gather from their name, master recipe tomes contain complex recipes that require a master's hand to create."
7,"TEXT_REGLAKGUIDINGSTAR_00246_TALK_A1_2","'Tis rumored there are others who can teach master recipes. If you've any interest at all, you would do well to seek out these individuals."
8,"TEXT_REGLAKGUIDINGSTAR_00246_TALK_A2_1","Artisan's and forager's gear, you say? The procurement of these is best suited to those who already possess as fine a tool as the guilds can provide."
9,"TEXT_REGLAKGUIDINGSTAR_00246_TALK_A2_2","Talan can be persuaded to part with tools and armor both...in exchange for a few objects you can craft or gather."
10,"TEXT_REGLAKGUIDINGSTAR_00246_TALK_A2_3","There are also pieces of artisan's and forager's gear you can fashion for yourself, assuming you have the right master recipe and materials. The market boards may help with the latter, I shouldn't wonder."
11,"TEXT_REGLAKGUIDINGSTAR_00246_TALK_A3_1","A guildmaster's best instrument made even finer─<Emphasis>that</Emphasis> is a supra tool. Should you wish to acquire one, you must needs barter with Talan."
12,"TEXT_REGLAKGUIDINGSTAR_00246_TALK_A3_2","He will ask for items you yourself have crafted or gathered, along with demimateria─either of the mastercraft or grade three fieldcraft variety. These you can acquire by desynthesizing artisan's or forager's gear."
13,"TEXT_REGLAKGUIDINGSTAR_00246_TALK_A3_3","But there is a chance you need not break apart your hard-earned gear. No, I should browse the market boards beforehand─who knows what demimateria will turn up?"
14,"TEXT_REGLAKGUIDINGSTAR_00246_TALK_A4_1","Lucis tools are supra tools honed nigh unto perfection. Should you seek such as these, you must begin by crafting or gathering exquisite items. "
15,"TEXT_REGLAKGUIDINGSTAR_00246_TALK_A4_2","Yet these alone will not be enough. Try to read treasure maps, or barter with company and allied seals. Indeed, you could consider undertaking leves, or even treating with Ixali crafters for what you seek."
16,"TEXT_REGLAKGUIDINGSTAR_00246_TALK_A4_3","Yes, this road to obtaining a lucis tool is daunting, but there is no more worthy path for adepts with a supra tool to walk. And I think, my friend, you will be most pleased at journey's end!"
