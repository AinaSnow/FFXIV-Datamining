2,"TEXT_REGDRA2MOGHOME_00287_MOGGIE_002","Ah, no Sid or Rielle today? Just you, kupo? That's a shame. Anyway, I am still the second-most well-informed moogle here, so if you have questions, ask away!"

That's why, next to Chieftain Moglin, I'm the second-most well-informed moogle in all of Moghome!"
9,"TEXT_REGDRA2MOGHOME_00287_MOGGIE_012","If anything is troubling you, or you have any questions, chances are I'll be able to help. We won't be hiding or running away anymore, kupo!"
