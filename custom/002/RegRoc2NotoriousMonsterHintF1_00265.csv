As the climate has got colder and colder, creatures that were never native to Coerthas have come down from the mountains to find food."
10,"TEXT_REGROC2NOTORIOUSMONSTERHINTF1_00265_ALEXONDRE_000_011","The mylodons are one such species. Time was they made their home up in the far reaches of Abalathia's Spine, but ever since their hunting grounds were lost to the Calamity, they've found their way down here. They're fierce carnivores, who see steel-clad knights as nothing more than a packed lunch."
11,"TEXT_REGROC2NOTORIOUSMONSTERHINTF1_00265_ALEXONDRE_000_012","Alteci's the worst of the lot─a mad mylodon who's been laying waste to the local forces. At the last count, more than a dozen noble lives have been lost to that monster."
12,"TEXT_REGROC2NOTORIOUSMONSTERHINTF1_00265_ALEXONDRE_000_020","Have you ever come across an archaeornis? At first sight you might think they were birds, what with the feathers and all, but they're actually a primitive species of scalekin, closer to raptors than they are to chocobos."
13,"TEXT_REGROC2NOTORIOUSMONSTERHINTF1_00265_ALEXONDRE_000_021","The only thing they definitely share with birds is their brains─that combination of mental weakness and physical strength makes them perfect thralls for the dragons, who use them to launch constant attacks on the Ishgardian forces."
14,"TEXT_REGROC2NOTORIOUSMONSTERHINTF1_00265_ALEXONDRE_000_022","The knights are particularly wary of the one they call Kreutzet. He's got such strength in those thighs of his, even the thickest snowdrift's not enough to slow him down. He races hither and thither across the snowfields, tearing apart any outpost unlucky enough to stand in his way."
15,"TEXT_REGROC2NOTORIOUSMONSTERHINTF1_00265_ALEXONDRE_000_030","Once every hundred thousand years or so, a yeti is born with a horn atop its massy head that is imbued with an extraordinary magical power. When the creature reaches maturity, it sends out a clarion call to the rest of the yetis that unites them under the horned one's rule."
16,"TEXT_REGROC2NOTORIOUSMONSTERHINTF1_00265_ALEXONDRE_000_031","...Or so the old wives' tale goes. The problem is, there might just be some truth in it. The Convictors believe they may have sighted such a “horned one.”"
17,"TEXT_REGROC2NOTORIOUSMONSTERHINTF1_00265_ALEXONDRE_000_032","The first thing they did was to name her Mirka─the second, to slap a bounty on her head. The yetis are dangerous enough as it is, but if this beast lives to maturity and brings them together as a single force, they could be nigh on unstoppable."
18,"TEXT_REGROC2NOTORIOUSMONSTERHINTF1_00265_ALEXONDRE_000_040","There was once a dragonslayer who was out hunting his prey on the frozen lake of Ashpool, when he made a surprising discovery. An enormous animal was frozen solid underneath the ice."

Freed from its icy prison, it began to breathe once more, and lashed out at all around it with elemental fury. When the dragonslayer set out to hunt for dragons, I doubt he expected to meet his end at the point of a tusk."
21,"TEXT_REGROC2NOTORIOUSMONSTERHINTF1_00265_ALEXONDRE_000_050","No doubt you've heard of the behemoths, those monstrous beasts that have been a bane on Coerthas ever since the Calamity.

Due to its giant size and superior strength, it has become known as the king of the behemoths."
23,"TEXT_REGROC2NOTORIOUSMONSTERHINTF1_00265_ALEXONDRE_000_052","They say that this kaiser behemoth, whose body is crisscrossed with the scars of a thousand battles, seeks any opportunity to avenge itself on the adventurers who defeated its brothers. If you value your life, I'd avoid doing anything to arouse its ire."
