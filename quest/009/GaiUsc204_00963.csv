1,"TEXT_GAIUSC204_00963_SEQ_01","In exchange for furnishing you with the corrupted crystal you seek, Davyd wants you to help him resolve the undead situation. To that end, he would have you first discover the cause behind the sudden influx of shambling corpses. Begin your inquiries by speaking with the party of adventurers who have made camp on the eastern shore."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSC204_00963_SEQ_02","The adventurers speak of a beautiful, irresistible voice heard at the Ship Graveyard, which may be connected to the undead. Report your findings to Davyd."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSC204_00963_SEQ_03","Although Davyd appears to have an inkling of what the cause might be, he does not deign to share it with you. Perhaps you should pressure him to voice his thoughts."

I'd be surprised if they knew nothing of the undead infestation, so it might behoove you to question them."
