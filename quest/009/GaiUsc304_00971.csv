2,"TEXT_GAIUSC304_00971_SEQ_02","You come upon the spriggan desperately trying to escape the wrath of a tempered sylph. In typical heroic fashion, you rescue the creature, who promises to return to the safety of Little Solace. Return to the settlement and speak with Komuxio to ensure that the spriggan kept his word."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSC304_00971_SEQ_03","Tiggy, the wayward spriggan, had petitioned the sylphs of Little Solace to put an end to Giggity's reign of terror. However, Komuxio observes that the notorious spriggan is clever and cautious, and will likely not reveal itself unless it is tempted by an especially rare ore. While Komuxio knows little and less of ore, he remarks that a goldsmith helping to restore the Sanctum of the Twelve surely does. Journey to the Sanctum and speak with Maerwynn."
