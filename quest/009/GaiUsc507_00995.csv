1,"TEXT_GAIUSC507_00995_SEQ_01","According to Wandering Breeze, the gigas who recently met their end at your hands may not have been quite the mindless brutes you took them for. Like a good historian─or a tactician─Wandering Breeze wants to study the threat. Slay four gigas and search their remains for items of interest."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSC507_00995_SEQ_02","You find a jagged piece of crystal on each of the gigas, the only things out of place among their effects. The crystals seem to be carved in some fashion, but analyzing them is well beyond your area of expertise. Perhaps Wandering Breeze will have better luck."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSC507_00995_SEQ_03","Wandering Breeze theorizes that the gigas consider the Crystal Tower a holy place, and seek to claim it for themselves. Place the carved likeness of the Tower on the chosen spot, and see what happens."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSC507_00995_SEQ_04","Being a mite fuzzy on what a scientific observation entails, you slay the gigas who comes to retrieve the crystal. The dead giant carries with him a detailed sketch of the Crystal Tower. Curious indeed. Hand it to Wandering Breeze and see what he says."
5,"TEXT_GAIUSC507_00995_SEQ_05","The drawing turns out to be from the documents stolen from the Sons of Saint Coinach. Do these fell creatures also burn to discover the secret of the Crystal Tower? If so, they may be an even greater threat than was supposed..."
