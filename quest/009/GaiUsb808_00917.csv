2,"TEXT_GAIUSB808_00917_SEQ_02","The cataloger states that he saw the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> land somewhere far northwest of the Observatorium five years ago. Though he cannot provide a more accurate location at the moment, he is confident that, with the right astroscope log, he could calculate one. To that end, he asks that you bring to him volume six of the 1572 readings─a large red leather-bound tome, which should be stored on the uppermost floor of the Observatorium."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSB808_00917_SEQ_03","Much to your surprise, you quickly locate and retrieve the correct volume. Return to the cataloger and present to him the tome."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSB808_00917_SEQ_04","The cataloger quickly concludes that the airship landed somewhere near the Stone Vigil, which means that it was almost certainly seized by the garrison which occupied it at the time. Report your findings to Lord Haurchefant and see what advice he proffers."
5,"TEXT_GAIUSB808_00917_SEQ_05","Lord Haurchefant explains that the Stone Vigil is currently held by Dravanian forces, and that all access to the ruined outpost is restricted by House Durendaire. To help you obtain permission to enter the Stone Vigil, he writes for you a letter of introduction to Lord Drillemont of Whitebrim Front. However, he suspects that his endorsement alone will not suffice, and he advises you to ask Lord Francel to write a letter for you as well."
6,"TEXT_GAIUSB808_00917_SEQ_06","Lord Francel is happy to oblige your request. Before you depart, he reminds you that the cravens who attempted to destroy House Haillenarte have yet to be revealed, and that they may target you in the future in retaliation for your interference. Duly warned, proceed to Whitebrim Front and present your letters to the sentry at the gates."

50,"TEXT_GAIUSB808_00917_NPC_000_011","Anyway, you were inquiring as to the whereabouts of an airship last seen in Coerthas several days before the Calamity, yes? Well, it so happens that I was monitoring the night sky at the Observatorium during that period. I recall that a small vessel came from the direction of Gridania and landed somewhere in the far northwest."
51,"TEXT_GAIUSB808_00917_NPC_000_012","Relying on my memory alone, I can say no more than that. However, were you to bring me the astroscope log from the evening in question, I could calculate a more accurate location."
52,"TEXT_GAIUSB808_00917_NPC_000_013","The log I require is volume six of the 1572 readings. It should be stored with the other past logs on the uppermost floor of the Observatorium, just below the astroscope. I believe it will be a large red leather-bound tome─though you ought to confirm the date and volume number if you are at all unsure."
53,"TEXT_GAIUSB808_00917_NPC_000_020","The past logs are all stored on the uppermost floor of the Observatorium. There's no security, so you can freely peruse them. Of course, even if you did find the correct volume on your own, it would be useless without an astrologian to interpret the data."

57,"TEXT_GAIUSB808_00917_NPC_000_042","Hmmm... It is as I feared. The ship landed near the Stone Vigil, of all places, which means that the garrison almost certainly seized the vessel and brought it within their walls. If so, then you would need an army of knights to have any hope of securing it."
58,"TEXT_GAIUSB808_00917_NPC_000_043","Though Lord Haurchefant is, from all indications, quite fond of you, so mayhap he can lend you a few? In any case, I have done my part. I shall pray for your success, friend."

In the chaos that followed the Calamity, the Dravanian Horde caught us unawares. The fiends have held the outpost ever since."
66,"TEXT_GAIUSB808_00917_FRANCEL_000_062","As we lack the strength of arms to retake the Stone Vigil, House Durendaire instead has been charged with the duty. Given that, I doubt that my words will carry much weight with Lord Drillemont. Nevertheless, I will write you your letter."
