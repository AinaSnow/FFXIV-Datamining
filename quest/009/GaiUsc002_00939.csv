1,"TEXT_GAIUSC002_00939_SEQ_01","Ser Joellaut, the injured knight currently recuperating in the infirmary, previously told you of the night when Inquisitor Guillaime first arrived. When you relayed this account to Alphinaud, he found several questionable details which he cannot reconcile. He asks that you retrace the path the inquisitor is said to have taken that night, and see if it sheds any light on this mystery."

4,"TEXT_GAIUSC002_00939_SEQ_04","Alphinaud declares that your discoveries prove that the Inquisitor Guillaime you know is an impostor. However, his true identity and objectives remain unknown."
