1,"TEXT_GAIUSC409_00984_SEQ_01","All evidence suggests that Minfilia and the others are being held captive at Castrum Centri. Cid bids you make your way to Revenant's Toll in Mor Dhona, and solicit the local adventurers for information."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSC409_00984_SEQ_02","It appears that Castrum Centri is presently on high alert, and you will need to rely on stealth and deception to rescue your friends. Before you begin your preparations, Slafborn suggests that you seek the aid of one Glaumunt, who he says has a personal agenda against the Empire."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSC409_00984_SEQ_03","You have informed Glaumunt of your intent to infiltrate Castrum Centri. If his response is any indication, it would seem you can indeed expect his aid."

50,"TEXT_GAIUSC409_00984_CID_000_002","Based on what we've learned, I believe it's safe to say they're being held at Castrum Centri."
51,"TEXT_GAIUSC409_00984_CID_000_003","So let us convene at Revenant's Toll in Mor Dhona─'tis as good a place as any to prepare, and better than most. The road leading east then south will get you there."
52,"TEXT_GAIUSC409_00984_CID_000_004","When we arrive, let us seek the advice of the local adventurers. We're bound to learn a thing or two that will benefit our mission."

54,"TEXT_GAIUSC409_00984_SLAFBORN_000_021","...Did I hear you rightly? Your friends are being held captive at Castrum Centri, and you want to rescue them? I don't mean to discourage you, but that might prove...difficult."
55,"TEXT_GAIUSC409_00984_SLAFBORN_000_022","The stronghold has been on high alert of late, with armored patrols seen about the perimeter around the clock. Not even a fly could get within a hundred yalms of the walls undetected."
56,"TEXT_GAIUSC409_00984_YSHTOLA_000_023","If the Garleans were alerted to our coming, we cannot know what they will do to Minfilia and the others. We must act with the greatest stealth."
57,"TEXT_GAIUSC409_00984_CID_000_024","Aye, it has to be good old-fashioned infiltration."
58,"TEXT_GAIUSC409_00984_YDA_000_025","But with security so tight, how are we going to smuggle ourselves in?"
59,"TEXT_GAIUSC409_00984_CID_000_026","Why, I've a mind to walk through the front door."

61,"TEXT_GAIUSC409_00984_CID_000_028","Aye, we'll disguise ourselves as imperial troops and march right in."
62,"TEXT_GAIUSC409_00984_CID_000_029","For this, we'll need a few sets of imperial uniforms, a suit of magitek armor, and impeccable timing."
63,"TEXT_GAIUSC409_00984_SLAFBORN_000_030","Heh, that's a bold strategy, but it just might work. Where we are, there's certainly no shortage of opportunities to <Emphasis>borrow</Emphasis> the equipment."
64,"TEXT_GAIUSC409_00984_SLAFBORN_000_031","Knowing those imperial bastards, they won't even suspect that we savage Eorzeans would think to use their technology."

66,"TEXT_GAIUSC409_00984_SLAFBORN_000_033","If you're determined to go ahead with this, I'd recommend you speak with Glaumunt."
67,"TEXT_GAIUSC409_00984_SLAFBORN_000_034","The fellow's got a personal grudge against the Empire, and happens to know a deal about Castrum Centri besides. I've no doubt that he'd want to be of aid."
68,"TEXT_GAIUSC409_00984_YSHTOLA_000_035","Yda and I shall go to reconnoiter Garlean activity at the stronghold. It would not do if something were to befall our comrades before we had the chance to act."
