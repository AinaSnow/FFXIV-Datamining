1,"TEXT_GAIUSC013_00950_SEQ_01","Meurise receives word that a patrol from another camp huddles in the Behemoth's Dominion, their reckoning shredded by the howling winds and snow. Sending medics with litters is out of the question, but emergency brandewine may do the trick."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSC013_00950_SEQ_02","You give the bottle of brandewine to one of the men, who rapidly emerges from his stupor. He will see to the rest of the men, and use this lull in the storm to return to their camp. You must do likewise, lest you make the same mistake they did."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSC013_00950_SEQ_03","Thanks to the restorative brandewine you have conveyed, the patrol has made it back to camp without losing a single man. You have apparently saved their lives for better things─namely, dying in a much more painful way."
