That they gave you a memorable challenge, one that you would proudly share with comrades over a tankard of ale. But Eorzea is no faerie-tale world, and life is not a song. Sometimes you slay a primal, sometimes not. But perhaps Ser Clotairion will have a greater appreciation for your accomplishments."
