2,"TEXT_HEAVNG102_02357_SEQ_02","Cid seems bent on heading directly for Carteneau, but Alphinaud requests a short delay to confirm the situation in the East Shroud before departing. Having acquiesced to Alphinaud's wish, Cid offers to fly the remaining members of the contingent to Mor Dhona. Speak with Hida at the landing gate when you are ready to board the <Emphasis>Enterprise Excelsior</Emphasis>."

4,"TEXT_HEAVNG102_02357_SEQ_04","Cid apologizes for not being able to land within the settlement proper, and suggests that you all retire to the Rising Stones. Perhaps this would be a suitable place to approach Nero, and learn more of your unexpected ally..."

The samurai has arrived with dire news from Doma, but far from persuading Yugiri to return to her homeland, he is instead convinced by Nero's mention of the Empire to join the mission to Carteneau. Speak with Yda when you are ready to set forth."
