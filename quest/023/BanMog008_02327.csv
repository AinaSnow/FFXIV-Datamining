2,"TEXT_BANMOG008_02327_SEQ_02","Both Ohl Deeh and Tarresson thank you for your help during the long project, and both declare their intent to remain with the Mogmenders for the foreseeable future. They will labor to repair Zenith, and say that your aid─and company─will always be welcome with open arms."
3,"TEXT_BANMOG008_02327_SEQ_03","Mogzin expresses his sincerest gratitude for all of your hard work and tutelage. Looking to the future, he says that the Mogmenders will soon begin work on Zenith proper, and hopes that the lessons learned at Bahrr Lehs will aid them in that endeavor. Mogzin reluctantly bids you farewell, and assures you that there will always be an extra set of tools ready should you ever wish join the moogles again."

51,"TEXT_BANMOG008_02327_TARRESSON_000_011","On the contrary, I simply wish to offer you my sincerest gratitude for your help thus far. You have given this old man a meaningful way to spend his days, and thanks to the efforts of all and sundry, I have recaptured a piece of my family's history."
52,"TEXT_BANMOG008_02327_TARRESSON_000_013","Yes, <Emphasis>my</Emphasis> family. For although House Dzemael is now renowned for its skill at stonemasonry, that was not always the case. No, as recently as three centuries ago, we were but humble crafters."

54,"TEXT_BANMOG008_02327_TARRESSON_000_015","A name which rings familiar, yes? One of the three original architects of Bahrr Lehs: Marinche de Faurechort. His blood courses through the veins of every son and daughter of House Dzemael, and his teachings have enriched our lives."

57,"TEXT_BANMOG008_02327_TARRESSON_000_018","I never did feel entirely comfortable among the stiff nobility of Ishgard, and I doubt I shall be sorely missed. Certainly many will bid good riddance to me, but it does not matter. The feeling shall be mutual!"

62,"TEXT_BANMOG008_02327_OHLDEEH_000_024","After all of our hard work, I've come to understand why Gullinbursti felt so attached to this place. Perhaps in a thousand years, I'll look upon Bahrr Lehs with a similar fondness."

65,"TEXT_BANMOG008_02327_MOGZIN_000_032","No doubt we'll face difficulties that'll make repairing this plaza look as simple as painting a pebble. But the experience we've gained here will see us through!"
