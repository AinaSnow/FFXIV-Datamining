1,"TEXT_JOBREL401_02380_SEQ_01","No sooner do you nod your head in consent than Amphelice proceeds straight to the heart of the matter. You will only receive the singing clusters upon completing and presenting to her three deftly written tales of daring and adventure. Being no stranger to danger, and knowing where to find it, you set out to find inspiration for your writing.

2,"TEXT_JOBREL401_02380_SEQ_02","You emerge from battle, your mind swimming with scenes of battle to chronicle in your journal. It takes you no time at all to compose your first masterpiece, but your work is not yet complete. To that end, you set out in search for your next story.

3,"TEXT_JOBREL401_02380_SEQ_03","Though weary from battle, you lay down your arms to pick up a pen and record your most recent battle in painstaking detail. Your second story is complete. With only one tale of adventure left to write, you make haste to another place that danger might call home.

4,"TEXT_JOBREL401_02380_SEQ_04","The battle was fierce, a dance of blades where death was all but promised. Yet you prove victorious, and duly inspired. With a flourish of your pen you write what could only be your magnum opus, completing the set of three stories promised to Amphelice. Heading to Idyllshire, you wonder if she will consider your work worthy of the singing clusters."
5,"TEXT_JOBREL401_02380_SEQ_05","Amphelice pores over your work and is almost at a loss for words. More than impressed with your work, she explains that she is a writer sorely in need of new ideas for her poetry. Or rather, she was in need of new ideas. Your stories have set her mind to racing, and she is only too happy to reward you with singing clusters.

50,"TEXT_JOBREL401_02380_AMPHELICE_000_003","But a single tale would scarcely be enough to even whet one's appetite, don't you think? That is why I must insist you write me three. Three gripping tales of derring-do, and the singing clusters are yours."

59,"TEXT_JOBREL401_02380_AMPHELICE_000_051","I am an artist, you see. A writer with a passion for poetry of the unexpected sort.
