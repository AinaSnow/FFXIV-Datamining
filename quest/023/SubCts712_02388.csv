1,"TEXT_SUBCTS712_02388_SEQ_01","During a recent expedition, the Wood Wailers were shocked to discover notes they believe to be penned by Nybeth Obdilord, the dread sorcerer who raised the Palace of the Dead. Knowing you had the misfortune of meeting him in person, they would consult with you regarding the contents of the documents. An expeditionary awaits you by the entrance to Issom–Har."
2,"TEXT_SUBCTS712_02388_SEQ_02","The expeditionary explains to you that he and his fellow Wood Wailers are puzzled by the strange script of the documents, which he surmises originated in a foreign land. E–Una–Kotor, having communed with the elementals, believes they are not from another land, but another world entirely. Taking the notes in hand, visions of Nybeth and Edda suddenly flash before your eyes. It would appear that his true purpose in building the palace was to master the art of resurrection, giving him the power to bring his lover back from the dead. E–Una–Kotor finds such a motive implausible, but with the dark sorcerer slain, the truth now remains buried in the hallowed grounds beneath Issom–Har."
