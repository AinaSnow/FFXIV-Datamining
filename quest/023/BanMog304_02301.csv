Mogek the Marvelous is staring intently at a group of Ishgardian knights."
1,"TEXT_BANMOG304_02301_SEQ_01","A band of Temple Knights have gathered in a tight circle just beyond Bahrr Lehs, an apprehensive air about them as they whisper to one another in hushed tones. Mogek is curious to know what has them so on edge, and having already tried and failed several times to eavesdrop on their conversation, he asks that you go and attempt to uncover whatever secrets they may be hiding.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANMOG304_02301_SEQ_02","Upon speaking with Hildeth you learn that the Ishgardian knights are planning to pull a prank of their own on the moogles to further cultivate their friendship. However, seeing as they are unable to fit their smoke bomb into the fake kupo nut they prepared, they are worried that all their scheming and hard work may never come to fruition. Help them synthesize a high-quality exploding kupo nut, and deliver it to the Temple Knight sapper in the Landlord Colony.

※In the event you lose the materials or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Hildeth."
3,"TEXT_BANMOG304_02301_SEQ_03","You deliver the fake kupo nut to the Temple Knight sapper, who gingerly sets it down in an area where unsuspecting moogles are most likely to come across it. Wait just out of sight to see if your plan succeeds."
4,"TEXT_BANMOG304_02301_SEQ_04","Two hungry moogles stumble across the trap you have set. As they move to pick up the delectable-looking kupo nuts, the little treats explode into a cloud of smoke, taking the moogles by surprise. Speak with the snickering Temple Knight sapper in Landlord Colony."
5,"TEXT_BANMOG304_02301_SEQ_05","You speak with the Temple Knight sapper, who is doubled over with laughter. In between fits, he thanks you, commenting that it was only with your help that they were able to pull this off. Return to Bahrr Lehs and tell Mogek the Marvelous of all that has happened."
6,"TEXT_BANMOG304_02301_SEQ_06","Mogek the Marvelous is delighted to hear that the Ishgardians have begun to embrace the moogle's prank-playing culture and believes they will have no trouble at all becoming friends."
