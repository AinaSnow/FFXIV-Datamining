Perhaps due to the strange weather in Azys Lla, however, he is unable to contact her using his linkpearl. He bids you travel to Idyllshire and request she come to Azys Lla while he makes final preparations for the anima's unveiling."

You use the strange device he gives you to summon the anima, and are astonished to see it has taken on a new physical form. Ardashir explains this is made possible using the anima's original soulstone. Rowena arrives soon after to behold the fruits of your hard work. She is pleased with what Ardashir has accomplished, and looks forward to seeing more. When he mentions his plans to seek out a new blacksmith to aid him, all eyes are on Gerolt, who makes clear his intentions to leave now that he is debt free. His liberation is short-lived, however, when Rowena reminds him of the vast sums of gil he has spent since they began work on the anima. Firmly back under Rowena's thumb, he implores Ardashir to accept his help. Meanwhile, the anima suggests you leave to seek out new adventures."
