Mogek waves his little paws excitedly."
1,"TEXT_BANMOG607_02319_SEQ_01","After discovering that the roar of dragons can strengthen the aspect of crystals in the vicinity, Mogek wonders whether the roar will have the same effect on kupa trees, strengthening the crystals growing within their massive trunks. He asks you to call upon Whei Ahf to test the theory, while also taking advantage of the opportunity to have him roar to strengthen a crystal cluster.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANMOG607_02319_SEQ_02","With a flip and a flick of the tail, the dextrous dragonet calls for Whei Ahf, whom you bestride and guide to the kupa tree.

※Speak with the dextrous dragonet in Bahrr Lehs to mount Whei Ahf."
3,"TEXT_BANMOG607_02319_SEQ_03","Whei Ahf roars upon the crystal, which begins to strongly gleam. The moogle nearby observes the growth excitedly as you take off to find the crystal cluster."
4,"TEXT_BANMOG607_02319_SEQ_04","Whei Ahf brings his magicks to bear on the crystal cluster, which shines brighter in response. Return to Mogek and report what you have seen."
5,"TEXT_BANMOG607_02319_SEQ_05","While it is too early to tell whether the results of Whei Ahf's roar on the kupa tree have been fruitful, Mogek is relieved that there appear to be no negative outcomes from the experiment. He expresses appreciation to you and Whei Ahf for your efforts."

49,"TEXT_BANMOG607_02319_MOGEK_000_001","Well, consider the kupa tree, rich in aether and a natural source of crystals. If Whei Ahf were to roar at one, surely it would bear even better crystals, yes?"
