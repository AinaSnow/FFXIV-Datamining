Master Mogzin is tugging at his pom in frustration."
1,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_SEQ_01","The Mogmenders are dealing with the latest in what has been a long string of difficulties. It is time once again to put your collective knowledge to work and find a solution to their current problem.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_SEQ_02","A shipment of supplies from the Temple Knights is long overdue for arrival, and Mogzin suspects that the moogles in charge of delivery may have hidden them. He takes it upon himself to find the moogles responsible and give them a harsh talking to, and sets off towards Asah. Worried that the crates will be too heavy for the moogle to carry back alone, Tarresson asks you to follow him and assist in the recovery."
3,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_SEQ_03","You catch up with Mogzin in Asah, and next to him you find a remorseful-looking moogle. Evidently, this is the moogle who hid the supplies, and after a stern lecture from Mogzin he has agreed to reveal their location. Mogzin is determined to handle this matter on his own, although he does give you one crate to deliver to Bahrr Lehs before departing to look for the rest of them."
4,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_SEQ_04","Tarresson confides in you that the supplies are meant to increase the speed of the Mogmenders' work. After observing that their current tools were unfit for a moogle's small paws, he surmised that wind-aspected tools might be more suitable for the flying animals. Before he produces tools for all the Mogmenders, however, he requires a sample to base the rest on. He enlists your aid in producing a special moogle hammer, and instructs you to bring the crate to Mogmul before beginning your work."
5,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_SEQ_05","Mogmul gladly accepts the supplies, although you can hear disappointment in his voice at the lack of kupo nuts. However, the hungry moogle remains diligent, and is ready to replenish your materials at any time.

※In the event you lose the ingredients or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Mogmul Mogbelly."
6,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_SEQ_06","As Tarresson applies the final touches to the hammer, Mogzin returns to Bahrr Lehs, bearing news that he has found the rest of the supplies. Tarresson then informs Mogzin of the gift you both made, and although the moogle is wary at first, he eventually accepts. With hammer in hand, Mogzin remarks that the difference between this tool and the old ones is like night and day. It would seem Tarresson's intuition was correct, and with these tools the Mogmenders can forge further ahead on the path to mastery."

53,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_TARRESSON_000_012","Give them a good talking to, Mogzin! As the leader of the Mogmenders, you must make it clear that you will not tolerate such trickery! I have faith the supplies will be here at Bahrr Lehs before long."

In fact, the zeal with which each and every Mogmender approaches their work has been naught short of astonishing. However, despite their best efforts, their progress leaves something to be desired."
67,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_TARRESSON_000_033","Curious as to why, I observed the Mogmenders at work, and one thing that struck me was the feebleness of their blows. Now, this is no fault of the moogles. It is not due to laziness that they strike so lightly. No, I believe the tools are to blame."
68,"TEXT_BANMOG005_02324_TARRESSON_000_034","The moogles cannot grip their tools firmly, and they do not have our thewy arms. Tools made for us are entirely unsuitable for them. But what if we were to furnish them with tools attuned to their aetheric energy?"
