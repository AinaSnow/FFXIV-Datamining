Mogek is beside himself with panic."
1,"TEXT_BANMOG401_02302_SEQ_01","Mogek tells you that the minions of Nidhogg have been harassing the Mogmenders. He asks you to seek the aid of Whei Ahf to fend them off, positive the wyvern's mighty roar will deter any would-be assailants.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANMOG401_02302_SEQ_02","You seek to entreat Whei Ahf but find a young dragonling in his stead. After hearing of the moogles' plight, however, he immediately calls for him that you might do away with their attackers. Journey together with Whei Ahf to the Landlord Colony and save the Mogmenders.

※Speak with the dextrous dragonet in Bahrr Lehs to mount Whei Ahf."
3,"TEXT_BANMOG401_02302_SEQ_03","No sooner do you arrive than you spot a moogle cowering before a pair of drakes. An angry bellow from Whei Ahf is all it takes to send them running. The Mogmender thanks you profusely and soon after retreats, most likely back to Bahrr Lehs. Whei Ahf implores you to continue your search for troubled moogles."
4,"TEXT_BANMOG401_02302_SEQ_04","To the east you find a young moogle beset by vicious peistes, but they are soon scattered by another terrible cry from Whei Ahf. The moogle seems surprised to find himself in one piece and flees before that is no longer the case. Your dragon companion still senses danger nearby, and so you press on."
5,"TEXT_BANMOG401_02302_SEQ_05","Heading south you spot a moogle confronted by a trio of tyrannosaurs. Though seemingly emboldened by their numbers, the beasts cower and fall back in the presence of Whei Ahf. No longer sensing any danger in the area, he suggests returning to Bahrr Lehs and informing Mogek that the dragon threat is no more."
6,"TEXT_BANMOG401_02302_SEQ_06","Mogek is overjoyed to see you return, assuring you that all the Mogmenders are accounted for. Should dragons or their followers return, the Mogmenders' marvelous manager knows who to turn to for help."
