Mogek is awaiting you with bated breath."
1,"TEXT_BANMOG503_02309_SEQ_01","Mogek apprises you of a discovery by the Mogmenders of a series of dragon statues on the perimeters of the Rookery, which appear have other uses given that unlike other statues, they glow with a faint light. He asks you to enlist the help of Whei Ahf, and travel to the Rookery to see if the statues respond to dragon magicks.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANMOG503_02309_SEQ_02","The little dragonling gladly calls Whei Ahf for you, whose back you climb upon. Make your way to the Rookery and have Whei Ahf use his roar on one of the statues.

※Speak with the dextrous dragonet in Bahrr Lehs to mount Whei Ahf."
3,"TEXT_BANMOG503_02309_SEQ_03","When Whei Ahf breathes his magicks upon the first statue, its faint purple hue gleams brightly, sending a beam of light to the heavens. The wiry wyvern comments that it is strange that a man-made statue would react in such a way in the present. Curious, he suggests you make your way along the perimeter until all are awoken."
4,"TEXT_BANMOG503_02309_SEQ_04","As you move on to the next statue, Whei Ahf recalls the stories of his elders and how wyverns would bear men upon their backs, just as you are doing now. Continue to make your way around the perimeter towards the next statue."
5,"TEXT_BANMOG503_02309_SEQ_05","Upon awakening the third statue, Whei Ahf mulls whether the statues can only be awakened in the presence of both man and dragon, which is why they had long been left dormant. Make your way to the final statue."
6,"TEXT_BANMOG503_02309_SEQ_06","In awakening the last statue, you hear the curious sound of stone scraping in the distance as if a door has been opened, and a nearby moogle wonders what could have been unlocked through the activating the statues. The investigation will need to be left to the moogles as Whei Ahf wishes to return to the plaza. Report your success to Mogek."
7,"TEXT_BANMOG503_02309_SEQ_07","Mogek is pleased with the cooperative efforts between you and Whei Ahf in testing the statues' magicks. He reflects that if the men and dragons of yore are watching in the heavens, they would be proud that you both once again stand in solidarity as they once had."

You hear a sound of heavy stone scraping in the distance."
