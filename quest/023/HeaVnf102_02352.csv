After bemoaning the unavoidably tedious workings of government, he asks that you delay your journey to Gridania once more to make a brief stop at Camp Dragonhead."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNF102_02352_SEQ_03","You find Ser Aymeric and Lucia at Camp Dragonhead, who invite you to meet the newly appointed garrison commander. Much to your surprise, you discover that it is none other than Ser Emmanellain─ably abetted by the rather more practically minded Honoroit. After leaving instructions to strengthen Coerthas' defenses, Ser Aymeric departs for the council. Travel to the Black Shroud, and rendezvous with the lord commander in New Gridania."
