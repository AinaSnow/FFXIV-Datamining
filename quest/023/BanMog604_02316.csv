Mogek points to Hildeth in the plaza."
1,"TEXT_BANMOG604_02316_SEQ_01","Mogek was attempting to steer you towards Hildeth, who has requested your presence. Speak to the Temple Knight to see what she wants.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANMOG604_02316_SEQ_02","Speaking in a hushed voice, Hildeth tells you that the Temple Knight sappers wish to repay the moogles for their hospitality by introducing them to Ishgardian stew. Upon the initial count of supplies, they noticed there were a couple of elements that had been forgotten in the order sent to Ishgard, and entrusts to your craftsmanship skills to make before the ingredients spoil. Go to Asah to request materials from Mogwon without giving away the surprise."
3,"TEXT_BANMOG604_02316_SEQ_03","Mogwon seems a bit inquisitive about your request as Hildeth often asks for building materials in bulk, but hands you the necessary crafting materials anyway. Synthesize the remaining elements for the Ishgardian cuisine. 

※In the event you lose the materials or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Mogwon."
4,"TEXT_BANMOG604_02316_SEQ_04","You return to Hildeth with the finished products, who then declares that samplings of the cuisine are ready to be handed out. She then asks you to deliver them to Mogwon and the hardest-working moogles you see."
5,"TEXT_BANMOG604_02316_SEQ_05","The moogles accept the meal trays with glee. However, as you hand them out, you notice Mogek with a puzzled look on his face. Return to him to ask what is wrong."
6,"TEXT_BANMOG604_02316_SEQ_06","Mogek is shocked that he did not receive a bowl of stew from you, and turns away to sulk, saying it had always been his dream to try Ishgardian cuisine. Hopefully he will receive one the next time that Hildeth doles out the stew."

52,"TEXT_BANMOG604_02316_HILDEATH_000_012","I thought to beseech your help, as when preparing a banquet, one always finds something missing. It takes quite a while for supplies to reach the Churning Mists from Ishgard, and we wish to serve the food to them before the ingredients spoil."
53,"TEXT_BANMOG604_02316_HILDEATH_000_013","Upon checking the supplies, we realized utensils from Ishgard are somewhat unwieldly for moogle paws. Perhaps you could use your skills to craft smaller spoons?"

62,"TEXT_BANMOG604_02316_MOGWON_000_030","Huh? Are you sure Hildeth doesn't need something a little stronger and heavier for building materials? She often asks me for resources in bulk."

68,"TEXT_BANMOG604_02316_HILDEATH_000_042","Deliver these to the hardest-working moogles you can find. Oh, and Mogwon as well. And let me know if they enjoy it."
69,"TEXT_BANMOG604_02316_HILDEATH_000_043","I know it seems like so few bowls for how many moogles are working, but we want to be sure that it suits their tastes first. There's no use in ordering enough ingredients to feed all if it will only be wasted."

76,"TEXT_BANMOG604_02316_WORKINGMOOGLE02316_000_056","It even has a little spoon just for me, kupo! No need to dig in with my bare paws. Although I am somewhat tempted."
77,"TEXT_BANMOG604_02316_MOGWON_000_057","Mmm, I can't wait to try it, kupo! This makes up for all of the headaches my team has been giving me lately."

80,"TEXT_BANMOG604_02316_MOGEK_000_070","What is going on? I just saw a moogle fly by with a delicious-looking sauce dribbled all over his coat."

82,"TEXT_BANMOG604_02316_MOGEK_000_072","<sigh> Oh, it's fine. It's not like I <Emphasis>told</Emphasis> you I wanted any. People forget, I suppose. It was just, you know, a little dream of mine to dine on proper Ishgardian cuisine, but oh well... <sniffle>"
