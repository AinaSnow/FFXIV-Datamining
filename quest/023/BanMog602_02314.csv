Mogek looks around the plaza before waving his paw at you."
1,"TEXT_BANMOG602_02314_SEQ_01","Mogek wants to give Whei Ahf a gift in return for his tireless assistance to the Mogmenders. Having heard that the wyvern is somewhat of a cloudfish connoisseur, he has sent one of his best anglers out to catch one to present to him. However, as usual, the mogfisher has not returned yet. Search for him at the Landlord Colony.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANMOG602_02314_SEQ_02","You speak with the mogfisher, who is happy to see an expert crafter before him just as he lost his last lure. He asks that you use your skills to create a new one of exceptional quality so that he may continue to search for the perfect fish to give Whei Ahf."
3,"TEXT_BANMOG602_02314_SEQ_03","You receive materials with which to create the tackle from Mogwon, who is apparently the younger brother of the mogfisher. Craft the best tackle you can so that the mogfisher can return to his work. 

※In the event you lose the materials or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Mogwon."
4,"TEXT_BANMOG602_02314_SEQ_04","You deliver your highest quality tackle to the mogfisher, who is more than satisfied with your craftsmanship. Playfully chiding you that a fisher never gives away his secrets, he asks that you rendezvous with him at Tharl Oom Khash after he has caught one that he feels will serve as an excellent gift."
5,"TEXT_BANMOG602_02314_SEQ_05","You meet up with the mogfisher, who hands over a cloudfish that he has never seen before, judging it to be a rare treat for a hungry wyvern. Return to Bahrr Lehs and speak with the dextrous dragonet so that Whei Ahf may receive his gift from the moogles."
6,"TEXT_BANMOG602_02314_SEQ_06","The dextrous dragonet's mouth starts watering at the sight of the cloudfish, but he calls Whei Ahf nonetheless. The wyvern is surprised and honored to be given such a rare delicacy that he had not seen in a long time. He asks that you express his gratitude to Mogek."
7,"TEXT_BANMOG602_02314_SEQ_07","Mogek is happy you were able to have a larger hand in the surprise, in both creating the tackle to catch the fish and bestowing it upon Whei Ahf. As a passing thought, he expresses relief that Whei Ahf recognized the cloudfish, as it would be a disaster to give him an unidentified poisonous one."

81,"TEXT_BANMOG602_02314_MOGEK_000_061","I am also somewhat relieved that Whei Ahf recognized it. The mogfisher said he wasn't sure what kind of fish it was, so it would be a disaster if it was poisonous."
