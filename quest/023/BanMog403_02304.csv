Mogek seems to be fixated on your tool belt."
1,"TEXT_BANMOG403_02304_SEQ_01","The Mogmenders are restoring an abandoned crafting facility in the Rookery, and Mogek would enlist the aid of his favorite artisan. He bids you seek out his moogle workers to learn what work there is to be done.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANMOG403_02304_SEQ_02","You speak with a moogle who tells you of how man and dragon once used the Rookery in the past, and how the Mogmenders are committed to restoring its crafting facilities. Unfortunately, he has no tasks befitting one of your skills. He suggests speaking with his partner, who has been taking note of what needs to be fixed or replaced in the Rookery."
3,"TEXT_BANMOG403_02304_SEQ_03","You find a moogle lamenting piles of rusted machinery once used for cutting fabric. He intends to salvage what he can from them, and asks you to craft components for their eventual replacements. Completed works should then be taken to his helpmeet.

※In the event you lose the materials or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with the miffed moogle."
4,"TEXT_BANMOG403_02304_SEQ_04","The helpmeet moogle seems lost in thought when you approach, pleasantly surprised by your delivery of new components. All that remains is to inform Mogek that your work is complete."
5,"TEXT_BANMOG403_02304_SEQ_05","Mogek is glad to see you return so quickly. Grateful for your contributions to the Mogmenders' work, he is certain these crafting facilities will be of great use in the future."
