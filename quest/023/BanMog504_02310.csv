Mogek shakes his head."
1,"TEXT_BANMOG504_02310_SEQ_01","An annoyed Mogek tells you that he allowed a group of moogles to take a break and explore the area around the enormous statue of Shiva south of Bahrr Lehs, but they have yet to return. He requests that you go and check on them to make sure they are staying out of trouble.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANMOG504_02310_SEQ_02","One of the moogles stands in awe before the Mother of the Sheave, and admires the dedication that the artisans of the past must have had to make such an enormous piece. Inspired, the moogle declares that he too will become a sculptor and someday create a moogle monument as magnificent as the one of Shiva. Of course, no fledgling artisan works without some sort of guide. He requests that you create a small moogle statue to use as a model, using materials that his brother in Moghome would be happy to give you for free."
3,"TEXT_BANMOG504_02310_SEQ_03","Unexpectedly, the fledgling sculptor's brother is somewhat skeptical of his declaration to create something as great as the Shiva statue. Nevertheless, he acknowledges you came all the way to Moghome on his behalf, and hands you the materials required to make the minute model. Craft the high-quality moogle statuette and deliver it to the moogle at the Mother of the Sheave."
4,"TEXT_BANMOG504_02310_SEQ_04","You hand over the statuette to the moogle, who is delighted and impressed by your attention to detail. He asks you one more favor─to inform Mogek of his newfound calling for carving sculptures."
5,"TEXT_BANMOG504_02310_SEQ_05","Unlike the moogle's brother, Mogek is somewhat supportive of his decision to become a master artisan. He muses the prospect of having moogle statues scattered throughout the Churning Mists."

52,"TEXT_BANMOG504_02310_CRAFTSMOOGLE02310_000_012","How many years would it take to carve a statue of this size, I wonder? Ten? Twenty? One hundred? Regardless, it is a display of dedication worthy of the highest respect."

69,"TEXT_BANMOG504_02310_MOGEK_000_050","I see, so he decided he would rather dedicate his time to sculpting. Well, I for one have no qualms with it. Not every moogle is suited to be a Mogmender, you know."
70,"TEXT_BANMOG504_02310_MOGEK_000_051","Besides, if he is successful in his mission, then perhaps magnificent moogle statues will be scattered around the Churning Mists, kupo! I am glad you were able to support him in his dream, no matter how big or small."
