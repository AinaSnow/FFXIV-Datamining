1,"TEXT_CLSTAN005_00051_SEQ_01","It would seem that an Ul'dahn merchant named Aymar has set about defaming the guild. He claims that the toad leather he purchased is of inferior quality. Geva intends to resolve the matter with a display of authentic craftsmanship, and bids you craft and present to her a circle of high-quality toad leather."
2,"TEXT_CLSTAN005_00051_SEQ_02","Your toad leather passes Geva's rigorous inspection. Present it to Aymar at the Carline Canopy, so that he may compare his purchase with an item of confirmed Fen–Yll provenance."
3,"TEXT_CLSTAN005_00051_SEQ_03","After gazing upon your magnificently crafted toad leather, Aymar realizes that the goods he purchased were not produced by the Leatherworkers' Guild. Return to Geva and reassure her that the guild's good name is not in danger."
4,"TEXT_CLSTAN005_00051_SEQ_04","Geva is delighted by the surpassing quality of your work─though it sounds as if she was even <Emphasis>more</Emphasis> delighted by the groveling apology of the Ul'dahn merchant. She is, however, deeply resentful of the unknown “Angrbotha” upstarts who she believes mean to exploit the guild's reputation. You cannot help but shiver when she adds that she would like very much to meet the leatherworker responsible for the whole affair...

※The next leatherworker quest will be available from Geva upon reaching level 30."
