1,"TEXT_SUBFST004_00027_SEQ_01","Artor, the newest member of the Carpenters' Guild, has set out for his maiden assignment without the necessary tools. Idele asks that you collect them from Louhelic behind the Oak Atrium, and deliver them to Artor at Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre."
2,"TEXT_SUBFST004_00027_SEQ_02","While muttering something under his breath, Louhelic gives you the new recruit's toolbox. Deliver it to Artor at Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre."
3,"TEXT_SUBFST004_00027_SEQ_03","Annoyed at first, Artor's demeanor quickly changes when you hand him his toolbox. Embarrassed, he then explains that it was his love of the amphitheatre and respect for those who saved it that first inspired him to become a carpenter. Supposing you a fellow carpenter, he thanks you and resolves to work harder, while encouraging you to do the same."

49,"TEXT_SUBFST004_00027_IDELE_000_2","Not a moment ago, we dispatched our newest recruit, Artor, to inspect Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre. Regrettably, the young Hyur has more spirit than sense, and he charged off without his tools."

57,"TEXT_SUBFST004_00027_ARTOR_000_23","You know, it's a miracle this amphitheatre even survived the Calamity. It was the Carpenters' Guild that saved it, moving it piece by piece and rebuilding it."
