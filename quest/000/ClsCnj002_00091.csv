Once again, however, your studies are interrupted by the young conjurer, Sylphie. As ever, she has no desire to deepen her understanding of nature, and refuses to heed his counsel. You, by contrast, take the Padjal's words to heart, and with the power of earth and wind at your command, continue your quest to master conjury.

※The next conjurer quest will be available from E–Sumi–Yan upon reaching level 15."
