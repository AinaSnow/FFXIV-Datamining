52,"TEXT_CLSHRV001_00003_LEONCEAULT_000_5","Our guildmaster's knowledge of nature is second to none. One need only witness her uncanny knack for spotting the finest timber to see that hers is a truly gods-given talent. It is for this reason that she holds the title of first botanist. Oh, but you need not be overawed, for she is the kindliest of souls!"

57,"TEXT_CLSHRV001_00003_FUFUCHA_000_13","But even as nature holds us in her loving embrace, providing for our every need, she is at heart an unsentimental creature. One that will take life just as readily as she gives it."
58,"TEXT_CLSHRV001_00003_FUFUCHA_000_14","Being a botanist means coming face-to-face with this uncomfortable truth on a regular basis. Knowing this, do you still wish to walk our path?"
