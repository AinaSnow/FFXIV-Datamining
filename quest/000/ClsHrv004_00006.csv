1,"TEXT_CLSHRV004_00006_SEQ_01","It would seem a botanist of the guild has caused some manner of trouble. In order to resolve the matter, Fufucha asks that you visit a merchant named Albgast in the Ebony Stalls and inquire after the details."
2,"TEXT_CLSHRV004_00006_SEQ_02","Albgast explains that he requires high-quality fresh marjoram in order to make his concoctions. The herb is said to grow around the Matron's Lethe. Harvest ten sprigs and deliver them to Albgast at the Ebony Stalls."
3,"TEXT_CLSHRV004_00006_SEQ_03","Fufucha will want to know how matters stand. Hasten back to the Botanists' Guild and apprise her of all that transpired."
4,"TEXT_CLSHRV004_00006_SEQ_04","Fufucha declares her intent to expel the botanist responsible for the incident, delivering a stern reminder that there is no place for greed in botany. Inspired by her principled stance, you hope that you too would be unafraid to take decisive action if the need arose.

※The next botanist quest will be available from Fufucha upon reaching level 20."

49,"TEXT_CLSHRV004_00006_FUFUCHA_000_2","Guilds such as ours exist only by virtue of the cooperation of their members. Each individual must set an example for the rest if the collective is to thrive. The time has come for you to set just such an example."
50,"TEXT_CLSHRV004_00006_FUFUCHA_000_3","A matter has arisen, the handling of which I would entrust wholly to you. You may deal with it as you see fit, providing you see the problem solved."
51,"TEXT_CLSHRV004_00006_FUFUCHA_000_4","The matter in question concerns a valued client of ours─the merchant Albgast. It would appear one of our number has done something to upset him."

53,"TEXT_CLSHRV004_00006_ALBGAST_000_10","Fufucha sent you, did she? Good. I'm not a man to mince words, so forgive me if I seem blunt."
54,"TEXT_CLSHRV004_00006_ALBGAST_000_11","You know what marjoram is? But of course you do─you're a bleeding botanist! It's a very common ingredient in alchemy, isn't it? <Emphasis>Very</Emphasis> common."
55,"TEXT_CLSHRV004_00006_ALBGAST_000_12","Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't you botanists supposed to be the experts in harvesting such stuff? Yes, you are. Strange, then, that the <Emphasis>expert</Emphasis> who brought me my last batch of fresh marjoram didn't so much harvest the poor plants as <Emphasis>dismember</Emphasis> them!"
56,"TEXT_CLSHRV004_00006_ALBGAST_000_13","Why, the leaves were so torn up, I couldn't recognize what they were at first. Needless to say, they're next to useless."
57,"TEXT_CLSHRV004_00006_ALBGAST_000_14","So, thanks to your herb-hacking colleague, I have no marjoram to make my concoctions. Which is why I inquired at your guild─only to be told you were out of supplies. And here we are."
58,"TEXT_CLSHRV004_00006_ALBGAST_000_15","Now, if it ain't too much trouble, I would be obliged if you could bring me ten sprigs of fresh marjoram. In fact, only marjoram of the finest quality will do, as opposed to the fine bleeding purée your bush-butchering colleague delivered."
59,"TEXT_CLSHRV004_00006_ALBGAST_000_16","Truth be told, I don't much care about your hatchet-happy friend. What I <Emphasis>do</Emphasis> care about is not keeping my customers waiting for their medicine. In short: hurry."

61,"TEXT_CLSHRV004_00006_ALBGAST_000_20","Did you get the marjoram? The herb is said to grow around the Matron's Lethe, though I hardly need to tell a botanist this. Do hurry─I'm keeping dozens of customers waiting."
62,"TEXT_CLSHRV004_00006_ALBGAST_000_21","Ah, the marjoram! And such <Emphasis>fine</Emphasis> specimens! I'm sorry I gave you such a hard time, friend. Thanks to you, I can get back to making echo drops."
63,"TEXT_CLSHRV004_00006_ALBGAST_000_22","Do you know of echo drops? They are an alchemical concoction that restores voice to silenced lips, allowing the imbiber to cast spells again. Conjurers and thaumaturges never leave home without a bottle or three."
64,"TEXT_CLSHRV004_00006_ALBGAST_000_23","But I must say again, these are some of the <Emphasis>finest</Emphasis> specimens of marjoram I've seen, and they're none the worse for the picking. It's clear you know your way around a plant."

67,"TEXT_CLSHRV004_00006_FUFUCHA_000_31","It is my belief that the botanist in question had naught but personal gain in mind when he so hurriedly harvested the marjoram. In his haste to complete the task and claim its reward, he damaged the herbs and rendered them useless."
68,"TEXT_CLSHRV004_00006_FUFUCHA_000_32","Such greed brings shame on our guild, and I will not tolerate it. The offender's name shall be struck from our roll."
69,"TEXT_CLSHRV004_00006_FUFUCHA_000_33","As I taught you when you first came to us, a botanist nurtures the natural environment to the mutual benefit of man and wood. He who thinks only of his own benefit has no respect for nature and is unfit to call himself one of us."
70,"TEXT_CLSHRV004_00006_FUFUCHA_000_34","Of course, you hardly need reminding of this. Something tells me you shall never give me cause to worry."

72,"TEXT_CLSHRV004_00006_FUFUCHA_000_36","If you ever find your work unduly onerous, you might consider outfitting yourself with better gear. Even something as seemingly insignificant as a new pair of boots can make a world of difference."
73,"TEXT_CLSHRV004_00006_FUFUCHA_000_37","As you gain in knowledge and experience, you will find yourself venturing farther afield in search of new bounty, and your choice of equipment will become ever more critical."
