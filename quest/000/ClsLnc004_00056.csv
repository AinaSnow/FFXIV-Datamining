1,"TEXT_CLSLNC004_00056_SEQ_01","In order to prove your readiness for the trial to come, you must defeat three experienced lancers in succession. Arm yourself and take your place in the training area."
2,"TEXT_CLSLNC004_00056_SEQ_02","You have trounced your comrades, thus proving your fitness for the trial. Speak with Ywain to receive further instructions."
3,"TEXT_CLSLNC004_00056_SEQ_03","To ensure the survival of the Lancers' Guild, you must prove your courage by facing the Lord of the Bramble Patch. Before you may do so, you will first need to claim ten bloody boar tusks from the wild boars that dwell in his dominion. Make your way to the Bramble Patch in the East Shroud, and bring your lance to bear upon the boars that reside there."
4,"TEXT_CLSLNC004_00056_SEQ_04","You have obtained ten bloody boar tusks. Place them upon the patch of trampled earth by way of an offering."
5,"TEXT_CLSLNC004_00056_SEQ_05","You have made an offering of the bloody boar tusks. Now you need but wait for the Lord of the Bramble Patch to grace you with his presence."
6,"TEXT_CLSLNC004_00056_SEQ_06","You have emerged victorious in the contest by virtue of your courage. Make your way back to the Lancers' Guild, where Ywain awaits."
7,"TEXT_CLSLNC004_00056_SEQ_07","Unable to bear Ywain's scorn, Foulques has fled into the depths of the forest. Though a bitter draught to swallow, this experience may yet give him cause to reconsider his beliefs...or so one would hope. Ywain commends your showing at the Bramble Patch, and bids you train hard in readiness for further trials. Encouraged by his words, you continue along the noble path of the lancer.

※The next lancer quest will be available from Ywain upon reaching level 25."
