The gladiator's comrades suspect one of their own, a former noxius named Langloisiert, may be responsible, but their lanista, Bubudoga, is convinced that other gladiators are responsible. Bubudoga also believes that the culprits may attempt to masquerade as fans to gain access to Franz and do him harm. Therefore, the lanista bids you surreptitiously investigate fans in the Coliseum and on the Steps of Nald by first posting placards and distributing flyers and then observing their reactions."

Now aware of his secret intentions, his comrades scold him for doubting the validity of his accomplishments, and convince him that the prince of the bloodsands, the pride of Ul'dah, the suave southern dandy is anything but a fraud. The party subsequently departs for their upcoming match, after which they will return to Halatali, where they will eagerly welcome you should you choose to join their training."
