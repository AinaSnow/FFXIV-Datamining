3,"TEXT_SUBFST024_00099_SEQ_03","Moved by Ailbert's words, Emeria has resolved to return the goods stolen by the lovelorn thief on his behalf. Deliver Emeria's message to Miounne at the Carline Canopy."
4,"TEXT_SUBFST024_00099_SEQ_04","Miounne reveals to you the truth about Ailbert and Emeria: they are brother and sister! Alas, Emeria has no memory of him, as she was too young to remember when he was forced to leave their home. Though Ailbert has yet to repent for his sins, perhaps Emeria's decision to return his gifts to their rightful owners will convince him to renounce his life of crime..."

71,"TEXT_SUBFST024_00099_EMERIA_000_40","But...how did he know my favorite flower?"
72,"TEXT_SUBFST024_00099_EMERIA_000_41","Is Ailbert...? No, no, it can't be..."

74,"TEXT_SUBFST024_00099_EMERIA_000_43","Forgive me this final request, but could you go to Gridania and speak with a woman named Miounne?"
75,"TEXT_SUBFST024_00099_EMERIA_000_44","You should find her in the Carline Canopy. Tell her of all that transpired here today. She'll know what to do."
76,"TEXT_SUBFST024_00099_MIOUNNE_000_50","Hmmm? A message from Emeria of Hyrstmill, you say?"
77,"TEXT_SUBFST024_00099_MIOUNNE_000_51","...I see. Oh, Ailbert, you fool... I'll deal with the stolen goods, worry not."
78,"TEXT_SUBFST024_00099_MIOUNNE_000_52","Yes, I know of the boy─and his family. He once lived in this very town."
79,"TEXT_SUBFST024_00099_MIOUNNE_000_53","One day, he stole a handful of chamomile seeds from an influential merchant in the Ebony Stalls. You see...this boy had a sister, and chamomile was her favorite flower."
80,"TEXT_SUBFST024_00099_MIOUNNE_000_54","Seeking only to make his sister happy, I doubt he grasped the gravity of his act. Regardless, his parents felt that he had brought terrible shame to the family. And so they disowned him."
81,"TEXT_SUBFST024_00099_MIOUNNE_000_55","Cast out of hearth and home, he grew desperate. And those who think only of survival think little of law. A common enough tale perhaps, but no less tragic for it."
82,"TEXT_SUBFST024_00099_MIOUNNE_000_56","And now you know the truth: the sister Ailbert loved so dearly is Emeria."
83,"TEXT_SUBFST024_00099_MIOUNNE_000_57","Emeria was too young to remember when Ailbert left, so her parents decided to conceal his existence."
84,"TEXT_SUBFST024_00099_MIOUNNE_000_58","However, word of the boy's banishment soon spread, and her parents were forced to move to Hyrstmill to maintain the fiction."
85,"TEXT_SUBFST024_00099_MIOUNNE_000_59","By now, Emeria's surely heard rumors of her long-lost brother, though a gentle girl like her would never question her parents' honesty. And whatever faint memories she once may have had are long gone."
86,"TEXT_SUBFST024_00099_MIOUNNE_000_60","But Ailbert has never forgotten Emeria. Despite the danger, I suspect he now keeps close to Gridania, refusing to leave his beloved sister a second time."
87,"TEXT_SUBFST024_00099_MIOUNNE_000_61","...I'll send Emeria some chamomile seeds by way of thanks for helping us to recover the stolen goods."
88,"TEXT_SUBFST024_00099_MIOUNNE_000_62","If only it were as simple as returning them to their rightful owners... Sadly, Ailbert's crimes will not be so easily forgiven."
89,"TEXT_SUBFST024_00099_MIOUNNE_000_63","But perhaps, by the time these seeds have sprouted and their flowers bloomed, he will have found a new path."
