An admirable stance, to be sure, but one which leads to disaster when her venerable seed pouch splits, depositing its cargo of Azeyma rose hips in her wake. Help the unfortunate botanist by gathering the lost rose hips strewn along the road to the Greatloam Growery."
2,"TEXT_SUBFST014_00041_SEQ_02","You gather the scattered rose hips with great care. Return them to Samiane and set her mind at ease."
3,"TEXT_SUBFST014_00041_SEQ_03","Samiane thanks you for your assistance in collecting the Azeyma rose hips. Though some seeds may have sprouted where they fell, she explains that all botanists consider it their responsibility to raise the Twelveswood's flora in the best possible conditions. That said, she concedes that a rose-lined path might not have been so bad..."
