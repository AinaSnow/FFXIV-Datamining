1,"TEXT_CLSHRV007_00009_SEQ_01","Much to Fufucha's dismay, the guild's crop of alligator pears has been devastated by vermin, and, to make matters worse, she has just received a sizable order for said fruit from the Carline Canopy. All hope is not lost, however, for the pears are known to grow in the wilderness. Solyeux at Bentbranch Meadows should be able to point you in their general direction."
2,"TEXT_CLSHRV007_00009_SEQ_02","According to Solyeux, wild alligator pears grow in an area northeast of Quarrymill. Harvest fifteen high-quality specimens and deliver them to Fufucha."
3,"TEXT_CLSHRV007_00009_SEQ_03","Thanks to your tireless efforts, Miounne will be able to offer her new salad as planned. Though you have saved the day, Fufucha reminds you that nature is capricious, and that her bounty cannot be taken for granted. Keeping these words close to heart, you continue your journey along the path of the botanist.

※The next botanist quest will be available from Fufucha upon reaching level 35."
