Should she continue to practice her magic, the young conjurer is in danger of sharing her mother's tragic fate. Deeply concerned, the Padjal pledges to search for a way to save the girl, and hopes you will aid him should a solution be found. Returning to the subject of your education, the guildmaster expresses his satisfaction with your mastery of conjury's fundamental principles, and grants you the use of the spell known as Fluid Aura.
