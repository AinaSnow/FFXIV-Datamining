1,"TEXT_SUBFST003_00026_SEQ_01","After first insulting you without provocation, Ethelred bids you deliver an Azeyma rose to Waldew outside the Conjurers' Guild."
2,"TEXT_SUBFST003_00026_SEQ_02","Waldew is delighted that Ethelred entrusted the task of delivering the Azeyma rose to you. He explains that the botanist has harbored a grudge against adventurers since time immemorial. That he was able to set aside his mistrust of outsiders represents a tremendous step forward. If Ethelred can overcome his prejudices, perhaps other Gridanians can do the same."
