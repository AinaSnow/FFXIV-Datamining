2,"TEXT_CLSHRV003_00005_SEQ_02","You learn that the crow feathers will be used to make arms and armor. While Cicely takes satisfaction from the thought that the feathers will be used in the nation's defense, it gives her pause that war may be coming to the Twelveswood once more.

※The next botanist quest will be available from Fufucha upon reaching level 15."

63,"TEXT_CLSHRV003_00005_CICELY_000_17","The scythe is what we call a secondary tool. Used in your off hand, it allows you to harvest from lush vegetation in addition to the mature trees you already know so well."
64,"TEXT_CLSHRV003_00005_CICELY_000_18","That Fufucha has seen fit to make you this gift is proof positive of your progress. You're no longer a novice, my friend. I daresay you're ready to try your hand at fieldcraft leves, perhaps even take on Grand Company work."
65,"TEXT_CLSHRV003_00005_CICELY_000_19","But first, I recommend you head into the wood and find some lush vegetation to try that new scythe on. Off you go now, and come back when you're ready to take on another task for the guild!"
