Just when it seems that bloodshed is inevitable, the unknown intruder chooses to withdraw, leaving you to ponder his parting words. Perhaps Ywain can shed some light on this incident."
6,"TEXT_CLSLNC001_00047_SEQ_06","According to Ywain, it is not uncommon for rogue lancers to challenge members of the guild. He tells you to pay the uninvited guest no further heed, and to focus instead on preparing for the coming trial.

49,"TEXT_CLSLNC001_00047_YWAIN_000_2","You will recall my telling you that it takes no small amount of courage to be a lancer. Now, in general terms, “courage” is the strength to do something which one finds unnerving."
50,"TEXT_CLSLNC001_00047_YWAIN_000_3","However, a lancer's notion of courage is not so simple. Having first drawn a distinction between courage and recklessness, he then divides the former into two aspects. I would have you learn each with spear in hand."
51,"TEXT_CLSLNC001_00047_YWAIN_000_4","The first is <Emphasis>composure</Emphasis>."
52,"TEXT_CLSLNC001_00047_YWAIN_000_5","When outnumbered in battle, a lancer may lose his composure and succumb to panic. Should this happen, all of his training will swiftly flee his mind, and he will struggle to overcome opponents whom he would ordinarily have bested with ease. He will, in short, contribute to his own defeat."
53,"TEXT_CLSLNC001_00047_YWAIN_000_6","If you wish to become a lancer in sooth, you must learn to maintain your composure at all times. Do this and you will be able to call upon every onze of your strength and skill when it matters most. And so to your first task..."
54,"TEXT_CLSLNC001_00047_YWAIN_000_7","The riverbanks of the Central Shroud are home to vilekin known as yarzons. Fiercely territorial, the creatures will attack anyone who strays too close, making them the bane of fisherfolk."
55,"TEXT_CLSLNC001_00047_YWAIN_000_8","They typically fall upon their prey en masse, barring all avenues of escape before closing in for the kill."
56,"TEXT_CLSLNC001_00047_YWAIN_000_9","What must go through the mind of their victim in that instant? Panic? Despair? Be sure to tell me upon your return. Needless to say, I would have you brave such an encounter. Take this sack of decidedly noisome bait, and use it to lure the ever-ravenous creatures out of their nest."
57,"TEXT_CLSLNC001_00047_YWAIN_100_9","It may be that only one curious yarzon appears, but what if two or three follow the scent...? Let us see how you fare then."

59,"TEXT_CLSLNC001_00047_YWAIN_000_10","Welcome back, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, and well done. I trust you now understand that in times of direst need, no amount of strength or skill with a spear will avail the lancer who lacks composure."
60,"TEXT_CLSLNC001_00047_YWAIN_000_11","You are now ready to learn the second aspect of a lancer's courage: resolve."
61,"TEXT_CLSLNC001_00047_YWAIN_000_12","When faced with a terrible foe, a lancer may succumb to fear and self-doubt. Should this happen, he will become defensive, and in seeking to cover his weakness, surrender his greatest strength─namely, his capacity to attack."
62,"TEXT_CLSLNC001_00047_YWAIN_000_13","A lancer who fears to attack is naught but a man holding a pole. His spear may as well be a broomstick for all the good it would do him. It is not and will never be a shield."
63,"TEXT_CLSLNC001_00047_YWAIN_000_14","That you may learn the truth of my words firsthand, I bid you go to the Central Shroud, to an area adjoining the abandoned dungeon known as Spirithold."
64,"TEXT_CLSLNC001_00047_YWAIN_000_15","Since the Calamity, that neck of the Twelveswood has become a veritable menagerie of fearsome fauna."

66,"TEXT_CLSLNC001_00047_YWAIN_000_17","Hm? What manner of fiends can you expect to encounter? Hah! To reveal <Emphasis>that</Emphasis> would be to defeat the purpose of the lesson, my young lancer."
67,"TEXT_CLSLNC001_00047_YWAIN_000_18","I will say only this: if you face these foes with a lancer's resolve, you will surely emerge the victor."
68,"TEXT_CLSLNC001_00047_YWAIN_000_19","Once you have completed the trial, pray report to Jillian in the entrance hall."
69,"TEXT_CLSLNC001_00047_YWAIN_100_19","She has grasped the two aspects of courage, albeit with some trouble. Though I doubt you will encounter similar difficulties, her struggle has furnished her with certain insights which I think you would benefit from hearing."
70,"TEXT_CLSLNC001_00047_YWAIN_101_19","A lancer learns best when he is doing, aye, but the wisdom of his seniors is not entirely without worth. Go now, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, and do as I bid you."
71,"TEXT_CLSLNC001_00047_JILLIAN_000_20","I have been expecting you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. By your return, I trust you now understand the importance of resolve."
72,"TEXT_CLSLNC001_00047_JILLIAN_000_21","Like one's flesh, courage can be made strong. It is a matter of training each of its aspects."
73,"TEXT_CLSLNC001_00047_JILLIAN_000_22","Now, the endeavor may prove difficult in the beginning─gods know how much <Emphasis>I</Emphasis> struggled. You may suffer untold humiliation and more frustration than you can bear...but you must persevere."
74,"TEXT_CLSLNC001_00047_JILLIAN_000_23","Whenever you engage an opponent, whether in training or in earnest, make a conscious effort to fight with composure and resolve. Over time, doing so will become second nature, and you will acquire such courage as you never thought could be yours."
75,"TEXT_CLSLNC001_00047_JILLIAN_000_24","Mind you, not all battles entail a physical clash of might. It could simply be a disagreement born of a conflict in ideology."
