57,"TEXT_CLSCNJ000_00022_ESUMIYAN_000_13","Conjury is an arcane art that takes life and the living for its domain. Its primary purpose is the salving of hurts and the granting of protection."
58,"TEXT_CLSCNJ000_00022_ESUMIYAN_000_14","Adventurers such as yourself oft stand upon the front lines of battle. Owing to this, you are like to find yourself in many situations wherein a capacity for healing would be advantageous. Mind you, there is more to conjury than that."
59,"TEXT_CLSCNJ000_00022_ESUMIYAN_000_15","By harnessing the power of earth, wind, and water, conjurers are also capable of weaving spells that wreak havoc."
60,"TEXT_CLSCNJ000_00022_ESUMIYAN_000_16","In terms of sheer destructive power, conjury may pale in comparison to thaumaturgy, but its capacity to defend one against aggression more than compensates for this relative shortcoming."
61,"TEXT_CLSCNJ000_00022_ESUMIYAN_000_17","In mastering healing and purification, not only will you be able to mend wounds and purge afflictions─you will also be able to breathe life back into the fallen."
62,"TEXT_CLSCNJ000_00022_ESUMIYAN_000_18","More than simply healers, yet not true dealers of destruction, conjurers realize their full potential when they employ their powers in support of others. This, my dear adventurer, is what it means to be one of us."
63,"TEXT_CLSCNJ000_00022_ESUMIYAN_000_19","...Hm, mayhap that was too much to grasp upon a single hearing. But worry not, for the meaning of my words will become clear to you in due time."

87,"TEXT_CLSCNJ000_00022_ESUMIYAN_000_49","Go forth, my young conjurer, and be at one with the world. Return to me when you have learned to draw upon the forces around you with the selfsame ease you draw upon those within."
