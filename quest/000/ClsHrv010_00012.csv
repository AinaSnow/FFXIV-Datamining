0,"TEXT_CLSHRV010_00012_SEQ_00","Recent developments have Fufucha feeling increasingly unsure of herself."
1,"TEXT_CLSHRV010_00012_SEQ_01","Fufucha has received a request for mistletoe from the Order of the Twin Adder, but is concerned as to how the plant will be used. Go to the Adders' Nest and inquire of Second Serpent Lieutenant Gavin as to the nature of the request."
2,"TEXT_CLSHRV010_00012_SEQ_02","Fufucha will be dismayed to hear that this latest order will once more serve the war effort, but the request must be honored. Harvest twenty sprigs of mistletoe from the vicinity of Camp Dragonhead in the Coerthas central highlands, and deliver them back to Fufucha at the Botanists' Guild."
3,"TEXT_CLSHRV010_00012_SEQ_03","Though appreciative of your efforts, Fufucha continues to have deep misgivings about contributing to a war effort that has left such scars on the forest she so loves, to the point that she is considering abandoning the path of the botanist.

※The next botanist quest will be available from Fufucha upon reaching level 50."

49,"TEXT_CLSHRV010_00012_FUFUCHA_000_001","The Order of the Twin Adder has commissioned from us mistletoe in staggering quantities. You will need to search in the vicinity of Camp Dragonhead in the central highlands of Coerthas."

53,"TEXT_CLSHRV010_00012_GAVIN_000_011","I've no intent to deceive her, nor you. The mistletoe will be used to prepare medicines for the battles ahead. It is as simple as that."

62,"TEXT_CLSHRV010_00012_FUFUCHA_000_024","War is inevitable. This I understand. But by aiding the war effort, we do not merely contribute to the suffering, we profit from it. No better than the parasitic mistletoe, we suck the life out of the trees that shelter us for our own personal gain."
63,"TEXT_CLSHRV010_00012_FUFUCHA_000_025","...A parasite. Is that what our once-proud guild has been reduced to? How can I in good conscience permit this to go on? Forgive me, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I would be alone with my thoughts for a while."
