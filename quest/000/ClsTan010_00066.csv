1,"TEXT_CLSTAN010_00066_SEQ_01","Geva's decision to withdraw from the exhibition has done little for her nerves, as what little free time she gained has been spent filling commissions for customers. Unable to deliver her wares herself, she has entrusted you with a choker ordered by a client, who is currently waiting at the Whistling Miller."
2,"TEXT_CLSTAN010_00066_SEQ_02","The customer to whom you delivered the choker turned out to be none other than Dauid, owner of Angrbotha Apparel and Accoutrements, the organization responsible for many of the guild's recent troubles. Not content to disparage Geva and her work, the charlatan also has the audacity to offer you employment. Return to the Leatherworkers' Guild and inform Geva of this troubling development."
3,"TEXT_CLSTAN010_00066_SEQ_03","Incensed by Dauid's words, Geva bids you represent the Leatherworkers' Guild at the upcoming exhibition. Fashion a raptorskin jerkin enhanced with a gatherer's grasp materia of the third grade, then submit your work to Estaine at Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre."
4,"TEXT_CLSTAN010_00066_SEQ_04","You complete your jerkin and submit it just in time for the exhibition to begin. Though the judges are initially swayed by Angrbotha's rugged yet serviceable craftsmanship, your late entry quickly earns the accolades of all present, and ultimately the award for best in show. A stunned Dauid is then forced to accompany two Wailers, as his questionable business practices have at last come to light. Return to the Leatherworkers' Guild and report to Geva."
5,"TEXT_CLSTAN010_00066_SEQ_05","Your triumph at the exhibition leads Geva to declare your apprenticeship is over, and that you are now a full-fledged artisan of the Leatherworkers' Guild. As her hands will be full retraining those who have returned to the guild from Angrbotha, Geva will most assuredly be counting on your aid again. Continue to hone your skills so as not to disappoint her.

※The next leatherworker quest will be available from Geva once you have completed the main scenario quest “Before the Dawn.”"

50,"TEXT_CLSTAN010_00066_GEVA_000_003","Withdrawing from the exhibition has freed me to devote my efforts to filling guild commissions. That is all well and good. The problem is that I now have more clients than ever, none of whom take kindly to being kept waiting."
51,"TEXT_CLSTAN010_00066_GEVA_000_004","Bah! For every moment we waste chatting, we risk losing a valued customer. Make yourself useful and take this choker to a client waiting at the Whistling Miller. On the double!"

55,"TEXT_CLSTAN010_00066_DAUID_000_013","Who am I, you ask? Why, none other than the founder and proprietor of Angrbotha Apparel and Accoutrements, Gridania's premier producer of leather goods."

63,"TEXT_CLSTAN010_00066_GEVA_000_024","What's that!? Dauid of Angrbotha was the client who commissioned that choker? If I had known, I'd have delivered it in person and taken the payment out of his lousy hide!"
64,"TEXT_CLSTAN010_00066_GEVA_000_025","Oh, yes, the two of us go back quite a ways. He was an adventurer and aspiring leatherworker─not unlike yourself, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. We had a bit of a falling-out, though."
65,"TEXT_CLSTAN010_00066_GEVA_000_026","I remember like it was yesterday. He strolled through that door wearing a shite-eating grin and holding a jerkin that looked like it had come out the wrong end of an aldgoat."
66,"TEXT_CLSTAN010_00066_GEVA_000_027","I told him as much, and the next moment, he ran back out the door, bawling like a child. That was the last I saw of him."

68,"TEXT_CLSTAN010_00066_GEVA_000_029","The sad state of affairs is that not all customers are so discerning. What's worse, if Angrbotha takes top honors at the exhibition, then their wasteful practices will be vindicated."

81,"TEXT_CLSTAN010_00066_MAISENTA_000_056","It would seem that an unprecedented number of last-minute withdrawals have left us with precious few candidates worthy of top honors. Nevertheless, we will proceed as planned."
82,"TEXT_CLSTAN010_00066_MAISENTA_000_057","Our next finalist is this lovely raptorskin jerkin, painstakingly crafted by an artisan of Angrbotha Apparel and Accoutrements. Judges, if you would."
83,"TEXT_CLSTAN010_00066_YWAIN_000_058","The cut is rugged, yet serviceable. It would seem that numerous skins were layered to afford maximum protection. Function over form─a lancer cannot help but applaud such craftsmanship."
84,"TEXT_CLSTAN010_00066_BEATINE_000_059","The tanning work is clumsy, but the sturdiness of the piece cannot be denied. In times of war, speed and practicality are virtues. I would say that it is worthy of consideration."
85,"TEXT_CLSTAN010_00066_GEVA_000_060","As wasteful as ever, I see. How many raptors did you butcher to create that misshapen mess?"
86,"TEXT_CLSTAN010_00066_DAUID_000_061","Ah, Geva. Fancy meeting you here. Stand back and watch as that <Emphasis>misshapen mess</Emphasis> is named best in show."

89,"TEXT_CLSTAN010_00066_OAPPPESI_000_064","Why, this is positively stunning. One can almost feel the raptor's very life force exuding from this jerkin."
90,"TEXT_CLSTAN010_00066_FUFUCHA_000_065","Not a single seam out of place, and not a single cut of the hide wasted. This piece was clearly crafted with a profound respect for the beast whose life was taken to create it."
91,"TEXT_CLSTAN010_00066_LUCIANE_000_066","It offers superior protection to the Angrbotha piece, while at the same time allowing for greater freedom of movement. This jerkin would be a proud addition to any archer's armory chest."

98,"TEXT_CLSTAN010_00066_GEVA_000_080","I must confess, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Until I saw your jerkin with my own eyes, I was not entirely convinced you had it in you. "
99,"TEXT_CLSTAN010_00066_GEVA_000_081","But you did. From this day forth, I am proud to call you not apprentice, but peer."

105,"TEXT_CLSTAN010_00066_GEVA_000_087","The life of a guildmaster is fraught with frustration. Yet I would gladly deal with a thousand hapless apprentices for even the slimmest hope of seeing one flourish as you have."
