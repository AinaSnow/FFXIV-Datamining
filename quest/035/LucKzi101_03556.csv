Beott sends the boy off to continue the search, and asks you to question villagers on the hammer's whereabouts."
3,"TEXT_LUCKZI101_03556_SEQ_03","You speak with an affable townsdwarf. He commends you on your fine dwarven manners before pointing out another villager who may have picked up the hammer in question."
