51,"TEXT_LUCKZJ004_03567_PLATOONLEADER03567_000_003","Alas, it's not so easy as all that, is it? And because his training isn't having as immediate an effect as he wished, he's become rather depressed. I know not what to say to him─as his superior, I fear that he will take my encouragement as chastisement."
52,"TEXT_LUCKZJ004_03567_PLATOONLEADER03567_000_004","If you spoke with him, however, he might take your words to heart. Can I ask you to attempt it? You will find him sighing to himself in Sweetsieve, like as not. Take him this, as well─I find that nothing so reliably lifts the spirits as a full stomach."
