Tolas would express his gratitude for all that you have done on his behalf."
1,"TEXT_LUCKZH005_03515_SEQ_01","Tolas is well pleased to see you return, and cheerfully explains that he has resumed his duties with the guard since last you met. He then mentions that he is about to depart for the Crystarium in order to place a supply order with Mauwyl. He invites you along, that you might together clear the roads to the city of threatening beasts, and subsequently reunite with your woodcutter friend.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_LUCKZH005_03515_SEQ_02","As you make your way through the woods, you come upon Tolas standing over the body of a fallen monster. The guardsman explains that he was attacked by the beast, but was able to make short work of it, showing no signs of the crippling fear and anxiety that had plagued him when you first met. Feeling relieved and happy for your friend, you smile and press on."
3,"TEXT_LUCKZH005_03515_SEQ_03","Venturing further into the forest, you and Tolas come upon a pack of angry anemones. Tolas suggests that you dispatch them with some stink bombs, a handy tool the guardsman says will drive the beasts away in short order. Intrigued at the idea of dispatching monsters with nonviolent means, you take the unconventional instruments in hand and prepare for a game of toss."
4,"TEXT_LUCKZH005_03515_SEQ_04","The stink bombs are remarkably effective in driving away the beasts that had blocked your path. Pinching your nose to protect against the stench, you begin walking back to report to Tolas, that you might continue on your journey."
5,"TEXT_LUCKZH005_03515_SEQ_05","Tolas congratulates you with a smile, and further informs that the handy stink bombs were fashioned by none other than Mauwyl himself to protect him on his forays into the forest. Nodding your head in admiration of the young woodcutter's ingenuity, you stride off in the direction of the Crystarium."
6,"TEXT_LUCKZH005_03515_SEQ_06","As you progress further on, Tolas stops to comment on the inordinate number of monsters lurking in the woods on this day. You have barely opened your mouth to speak when you are cut off by a man's scream, apparently coming from a short distance away. You and your guardsman companion quickly rush to the man's aid."
7,"TEXT_LUCKZH005_03515_SEQ_07","At the scene of the scream, you find Tolas together with a familiar face: the guardsman Nielden, who had been beset by a fiend while gathering supplies. Though the men were able to dispatch the monster, Tolas suffered a light wound in the battle. Nielden insists that the two of you go with him to Fort Jobb, where your mutual friend Callea, might tend to the guardsman's wound."
8,"TEXT_LUCKZH005_03515_SEQ_08","Callea is overjoyed to see you again, and cheerfully volunteers to dress Tolas's wound. The guardsman is most impressed by the efficacy of the girl's hand-fashioned salves, and asks if he might purchase a batch to bring back to the Imperative. Callea is flattered, but explains that unfortunately she barely has enough ingredients to make potions for Fort Jobb. At your suggestion, Tolas proposes a plan: that you task the woodcutter Mauwyl with procuring the necessary herbs. Though she is reluctant to impose on the kindness of strangers, Callea agrees to accompany you to the Crystarium to make the request in person."
9,"TEXT_LUCKZH005_03515_SEQ_09","Arriving at the Crystarium with your companions, you enjoy a joyous reunion with Mauwyl. Hearing the proposal from Tolas, the youth cheerfully agrees, and all present rejoice at what is sure to be a beneficial arrangement for all the involved parties. Tolas offers an observation about your remarkable ability to bring people together. Bowing deeply, he offers his profuse thanks for all you have done─not only for him and his friends, but for the greater good of Lakeland."

As a matter of fact, I was just about to depart for the Crystarium to secure a shipment of building materials."
49,"TEXT_LUCKZH005_03515_TOLAS_000_001","I trust that you, too, will be returning to the city? If so, then pray give me the pleasure of your company on the road."
50,"TEXT_LUCKZH005_03515_TOLAS_000_002","Thank you so very much, my friend. The roads are dangerous these days, and I would feel all the better with a capable combatant at my side. Together, I daresay we could do our fair share to clear the path of threats for the travelers who will come after us."
51,"TEXT_LUCKZH005_03515_TOLAS_000_003","You may be pleased to know that the supplier I mean to meet with is none other than our mutual friend Mauwyl. No doubt he will be delighted to see you again as well."
52,"TEXT_LUCKZH005_03515_TOLAS_000_004","At any rate, see to whatever preparations you may have. I am ready to depart whenever you are."
53,"TEXT_LUCKZH005_03515_TOLAS_000_010","One can barely take a few paces without running into one of these fiends, no? As you can see, I had no trouble seeing to the threat."
54,"TEXT_LUCKZH005_03515_TOLAS_000_011","<Emphasis>This</Emphasis> is what you have done for me, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I am able to summon all of my strength and skill once more, and I fear for any beast that dares stand in my path."

57,"TEXT_LUCKZH005_03515_TOLAS_100_020","While we could cut them down easily enough, their endless screams and tittering are like as not to attract more of their friends."
58,"TEXT_LUCKZH005_03515_TOLAS_000_021","Fortunately, we've recently discovered a method for dealing with these creatures quickly and effortlessly. Behold the ever-handy stink bomb. When thrown, they emit a stench that─while barely tolerable for us─is positively sickening to creatures with sensitive noses."
59,"TEXT_LUCKZH005_03515_TOLAS_000_022","This will drive the beasts away, as well as deterring any of their friends from joining the party. Here's a handful of them: why not give them a try?"
60,"TEXT_LUCKZH005_03515_TOLAS_000_023","Just toss the stink bombs in the vicinity of the anemones, and watch as our foe scatters and skitters away to escape the stench."

63,"TEXT_LUCKZH005_03515_SYSTEM_110_030","The angry anemone lets out a pained screech and flees from the scene. A moment later, the stench of raw refuse and night soils wafts in on the air..."

68,"TEXT_LUCKZH005_03515_TOLAS_000_030","Rather effective, wouldn't you say? Thanks to tools like this, even new recruits and others less comfortable with a blade than you or I can hold their own against all manner of nasty creatures."
69,"TEXT_LUCKZH005_03515_TOLAS_000_031","In fact, it was none other than Mauwyl who procured these for us. As he tells it, they've long been favored by woodcutters, gatherers, and the like seeking to protect themselves during forays deep into the forest."

101,"TEXT_LUCKZH005_03515_CALLEA_000_086","I fear it's not so simple. The herbs used in my father's recipes are all native to these parts. Furthermore, they have a habit of growing in the deepest, most perilous parts of the forest."
