49,"TEXT_LUCKZI012_03548_RAKITT_000_001","That's my job, you see─making contraptions what can protect the village from eaters and such. My latest and greatest invention is the “ironbeard killer”!"
50,"TEXT_LUCKZI012_03548_RAKITT_000_002","...Well, maybe not the greatest. As soon as I turned the bugger on, it straightened up, twitched a bit, then raced right out the gate. And as much as I'd like to go after it, you never know what a failed automaton might do..."

54,"TEXT_LUCKZI012_03548_RAKITT_000_006","Head over to the southeast, then use that coal to set up your ambush. Oh, and once you're done taking that bugger apart, don't forget to retrieve the core!"
