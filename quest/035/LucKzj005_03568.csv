49,"TEXT_LUCKZJ005_03568_POET03568_000_001","...Apologies, I probably ought to provide context. I am composing a gift for my aged grandmother, who lost her sight some time ago. I wish to convey to her the endless beauty of the night sky─through verse!"
50,"TEXT_LUCKZJ005_03568_POET03568_000_003","To do so, however, I must explore the myriad emotions that that shimmering, inky expanse evokes in the heart─I'm sure you understand. Thus, I would beg you assist me in asking those of the Crystarium what the night sky means to them."
51,"TEXT_LUCKZJ005_03568_RAEQESH_000_010","How does the night sky make me <Emphasis>feel</Emphasis>? Fascinated, mainly. It's a far sight different than what I had imagined in reading of it. Brighter and...closer, somehow. As if I could reach out and touch it."
52,"TEXT_LUCKZJ005_03568_VALTHEWYL_000_011","I could scarce believe it, at first, that the night had returned. I stared upward, trying to burn it into my mind, wondering if it would disappear again. And then, I saw a star─I know not how else to describe it─<Emphasis>fall</Emphasis>. Astonishing!"
53,"TEXT_LUCKZJ005_03568_LEWERALTH_000_012","The night... It is a strange and wonderful thing. Were I to ride my amaro ever upward, I wonder, would I arrive amongst the stars? I think I should like to."
54,"TEXT_LUCKZJ005_03568_RAEQESH_000_013","The books do describe it as “breathtaking,” but...I know now that I never truly understood what that meant. Not until I saw it for myself."
55,"TEXT_LUCKZJ005_03568_VALTHEWYL_000_014","After a time, I began to feel as if I might fall into it, you know. The sky. I wonder─if I did, would I shine as brightly as that star?"
56,"TEXT_LUCKZJ005_03568_LEWERALTH_000_015","Perhaps we would simply fly forever, through the dark. I wouldn't mind that, either."

58,"TEXT_LUCKZJ005_03568_POET03568_000_021","Oh, yes... That's <Emphasis>good</Emphasis>. I can feel the words stir within me!"
59,"TEXT_LUCKZJ005_03568_POET03568_000_022","I must recite this to my grandmother at once, whilst the image remains vivid in my mind. When you have a moment, might you come to the Catenaries and meet her? She's always so delighted by travelers' tales."

64,"TEXT_LUCKZJ005_03568_GRANDMOTHER03568_000_034","You didn't notice, child? You need to truly see the world around you if you are to make a living as a poet..."
