49,"TEXT_LUCKZH010_03520_SOLDIER03520_000_002","Maybe you'd be interested in helping out with what I'm planning. I'm a fairly decent cook, actually─I sometimes feel as if that's the <Emphasis>only</Emphasis> thing I'm good at─and I thought it might bring people comfort to know that they could come here and get a decent meal."
50,"TEXT_LUCKZH010_03520_SOLDIER03520_000_003","The trouble is, there are too many options as to what I could prepare, and I'm not much for making decisions. I would simply ask around, but civilians tend to get a bit nervous when a member of the army starts asking questions, and I don't want to cause anyone <Emphasis>more</Emphasis> distress."
51,"TEXT_LUCKZH010_03520_SOLDIER03520_000_004","That being the case─would you mind asking a few people what sort of dishes might lift their spirits? I don't need the recipes, just ideas."
52,"TEXT_LUCKZH010_03520_ROITATCHA_000_010","Food that would lift my spirits? Hmm... Voeburt muffins, maybe? My mother often used to make them."
53,"TEXT_LUCKZH010_03520_CHADDRIC_000_011","Free meals? Yes, that would certainly improve the mood around here. As for what people would enjoy─perhaps a dish that they've never had before? Though I'm not terribly familiar with anything other than Voeburtite cuisine, myself."
54,"TEXT_LUCKZH010_03520_LEAMOSHEI_000_012","How about Kholusian stew? It was a popular dish before the Flood, apparently. All I really know is that it's meant to incorporate a variety of seafood, but I've always wanted to try it─seems a shame that I've never had the traditional food of my homeland."
55,"TEXT_LUCKZH010_03520_ROITATCHA_000_013","The smell of baking muffins is absolutely divine, I assure you!"

66,"TEXT_LUCKZH010_03520_SOLDIER03520_000_023","Dough with seafood <Emphasis>inside</Emphasis> of it? That does sound intriguing. Salty shellfish and tender stewed catfish, together in a hearty bun... Yes, I can picture it."
67,"TEXT_LUCKZH010_03520_SOLDIER03520_000_024","Yes, that does sound pleasant. We can't focus solely on the food, after all. I haven't the slightest idea what an “Ishgard” is, but I'd certainly be willing to try brewing tea with lily bulbs."
