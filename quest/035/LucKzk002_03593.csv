The loquacious Amaurotine wishes to engage you in a battle of wits."
1,"TEXT_LUCKZK002_03593_SEQ_01","The Hall of Rhetoric is frequented by many Amaurotines eager to engage in debate and discourse, and the one who approaches you is no exception. After mistaking you for a young child unfamiliar with rhetorical traditions, they task you with summoning a friend of theirs from outside the hall in order to give you a live demonstration─and perhaps one in which you may be permitted to participate.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."

4,"TEXT_LUCKZK002_03593_SEQ_04","The firebrand at last relents and decides to hear you out, at which point you explain your purpose in coming. Recalling that they owe their colleague a debate or two, they declare that now is as good an occasion as any and stride towards the hall."
5,"TEXT_LUCKZK002_03593_SEQ_05","The two Amaurotines engage in a spirited debate concerning whether or not their city should attempt to aid a distant metropolis across the sea which is said to be struggling with an unprecedented calamity of late. Though the two fail to come to a consensus, their discussion provides insight into the thought processes of the citizenry, as well as an opportunity for you to join in the discourse to a limited degree."
6,"TEXT_LUCKZK002_03593_SEQ_06","The loquacious Amaurotine is a passionate believer in the free exchange of ideas, and they hope that your experiences in the Hall of Rhetoric will inspire you to participate in the public discourse when you are older. Indeed, they sense that you may have the potential to change Amaurot in ways no one might think possible, and they state that they will be watching your trajectory with great interest..."
