51,"TEXT_LUCKZJ009_03572_VONNDEN_000_003","Shhh, Vayne! Oh, it's too late now. We'll share our secret with you─just promise you won't tell anyone, okay? We were playing by our favorite tree, and we found a bottle stuffed into a hollow. And inside the bottle...was a treasure map!"
52,"TEXT_LUCKZJ009_03572_VONNDEN_000_004","You look like you've been all over the place. Have you ever hunted for treasure? Hey, maybe you could go treasure hunting for us!"
53,"TEXT_LUCKZJ009_03572_VONNDEN_000_005","We were going to go ourselves, but if the grown-ups caught us sneaking around in the forest, we'd be in real trouble. Please, won't you do this for us?"
54,"TEXT_LUCKZJ009_03572_YALRIC_000_006","Awww, I wanted to be the one to dig up the treasure... But fine. You can go, as long as we get to split the treasure four ways. We're the ones who found the map, after all!"
55,"TEXT_LUCKZJ009_03572_VAYNE_000_007","Thanks, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>missus<Else/>mister</If> traveler! Here's the map. The treasure's buried to the east of here, right where you see that big red cross. Good luck!"
