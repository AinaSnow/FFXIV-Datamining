56,"TEXT_LUCKZH009_03519_AARNER_000_015","I knew I could do nothing to change fate. So I came to Eulmore, hoping to forget it instead. Abandoned my work, my family...everything. And I felt no guilt for it, convinced as I was that nothing mattered."
57,"TEXT_LUCKZH009_03519_AARNER_000_016","Now, though, the scales have fallen from my eyes. I've always been a coward, and what I did was a betrayal of the highest order. And I know...I know there's no going back."
