49,"TEXT_LUCKZH006_03516_MANAGER03516_000_001","Wonderful! I require someone willing to undertake a dangerous mission, you understand. To venture to...<shudder>...the <Emphasis>Derelicts</Emphasis>. Word has reached me that our most popular honeybee, Solina, was spotted there of late."
50,"TEXT_LUCKZH006_03516_MANAGER03516_000_002","Both patrons and staff have had difficulty coping with the recent...revelations, but Solina must have taken it harder than most. She hasn't returned to the Beehive since. If you have the stomach for the task, I implore you─bring her back."

63,"TEXT_LUCKZH006_03516_MANAGER03516_000_036","Of course. My earlier statement was not merely referring to your physical well-being. I will leave the search to you and our stalwart friend here, but do return to the Beehive once you have located your beloved. I think you will find that your absence has been felt most keenly."
