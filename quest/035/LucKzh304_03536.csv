Tolas would immediately depart in search of his missing friend."
1,"TEXT_LUCKZH304_03536_SEQ_01","Outside the bathhouse, you reunite with Tolas, who has promptly dressed himself in his full armor. The two of you decide to make for the road just outside Radisca's Round, where it is believed that Mauwyl's caravan was attacked. Hurry to your destination, and pray that the young woodcutter has not already come to harm.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_LUCKZH304_03536_SEQ_02","Arriving at the scene of the ambush, you encounter a soldier who shares with you and Tolas the latest tidings regarding the search effort. It would appear that all the missing members have been found and led to safety, with the notable exception of Mauwyl, who remains unaccounted for. With time of the essence, Tolas suggests that you split up, that you might cover the most ground in your search efforts. The guardsman offers to search in the vicinity of Wolves of Shadow, and bids you sweep the southern edge of the forest for any signs of the young woodcutter."
3,"TEXT_LUCKZH304_03536_SEQ_03","Your search for Mauwyl has thus far proven less than fruitful, while a pair of nasty sin eaters' search for something to eat─namely, you─has proven more so. Fortunately, you are able to make quick work of your foe. The path clear, you resolve to continue to probe the forests for any sign of the missing woodcutter."
4,"TEXT_LUCKZH304_03536_SEQ_04","You have completed your search of the forest, but Mauwyl is nowhere to be found. You have no choice but to return to Radisca's Round and hope that Tolas's efforts have borne more fruit than your own."
5,"TEXT_LUCKZH304_03536_SEQ_05","As you are retracing your path back to Radisca's Round, you come upon a sight that is at once both startling and reassuring: Tolas standing over a vanquished sin eater with Mauwyl trembling by his side. It would appear that the guardsman came upon the woodcutter just as he was about to become dinner for the fiend, and succeeded in overcoming his demons to vanquish the foe and save the young man's life. Tolas explains that traveling and conversing with you have returned to him a measure of clarity and peace, freeing him from the paralyzing effects of his lingering fear and shame. Both men say their thanks, then set off for the Ostall Imperative, bidding you visit them there so that they might properly express their gratitude."
6,"TEXT_LUCKZH304_03536_SEQ_06","Back at the Imperative, Tolas and Mauwyl once again thank you for everything you have done on their behalf. The guardsman, especially, explains that it is because of you that he has rediscovered his sense of purpose and the will to fight. Mauwyl pays his respects and heads out to make a delivery, and Tolas prepares to return to his post, leaving you with an open invitation to visit him and his brothers-in-arms at the Imperative any time you like."

55,"TEXT_LUCKZH304_03536_SOLDIER03536_000_015","(-Crystarium Guardsman-)According to the survivors, the young man was forced to flee in the opposite direction from the rest of the group. His precise whereabouts, sadly, remain unknown."
56,"TEXT_LUCKZH304_03536_TOLAS_000_016","Understood. The forest or the ruins nearby would seem the most logical destinations to hide and seek shelter. <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, let us split up and cover as much ground as we are able."

71,"TEXT_LUCKZH304_03536_TOLAS_000_039","When the sin eaters came that day, I felt fear as I had never felt before. My pride as a warrior, the lives of the men under my command, all were consumed by a primal urge for survival."
72,"TEXT_LUCKZH304_03536_TOLAS_000_040","And so on that day, faced with my greatest test, with the chance to truly do my ancestors proud, I shrank from the challenge rather than rising to it. And I have cursed myself every moment since."
73,"TEXT_LUCKZH304_03536_TOLAS_000_041","What I would not give to have that day over again. If I had stood with my men on the front lines, served as their shield, how many lives could I have saved? That one thought grabbed hold of my mind, and would not release its grasp."

78,"TEXT_LUCKZH304_03536_TOLAS_000_047","If I allow myself to be haunted by the shame and the specters of that day, I will only repeat the mistakes of the past. No, I must overcome my grief and bitter regret─and fight on, for the sake of those I still might yet protect."
79,"TEXT_LUCKZH304_03536_TOLAS_000_048","But I could not have accomplished that alone. No, I could not have accomplished it without you at my side, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."
80,"TEXT_LUCKZH304_03536_TOLAS_000_049","As I watched you fighting beside me─with an unflinching sense of purpose, despite all the horrors you have seen─for the first time since the battle that day, my sword arm ceased trembling, and I felt a measure of peace."

82,"TEXT_LUCKZH304_03536_TOLAS_000_051","There is more I would say, but that can wait for another time.

86,"TEXT_LUCKZH304_03536_TOLAS_000_061","...<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Once again, allow me to express my most sincere gratitude for all you have done. Had you not come along when you did, I may very well have ended up dead before I ever regained the courage to fight."
87,"TEXT_LUCKZH304_03536_TOLAS_000_062","There is one more thing I realized reflecting on the matter. In my all-consuming desire to prove my valor and do my family proud, I lost sight of the most important reason that I fight."
88,"TEXT_LUCKZH304_03536_TOLAS_000_063","From today, I will put such lofty goals out of my mind─along with my past demons, as best as I am able─and fight as best I can for those who need me today."

90,"TEXT_LUCKZH304_03536_MAUWYL_000_065","Hah! That's right! I was wondering when you were going to get around to thanking the man who brought <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> here from the Crystarium in the first place! Which reminds me─I have a delivery to make!"
91,"TEXT_LUCKZH304_03536_TOLAS_000_066","Be safe, my friend. And thank you for everything."
92,"TEXT_LUCKZH304_03536_TOLAS_000_067","You as well, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I will be forever grateful for all you have done."
