49,"TEXT_LUCKZH001_03511_SVEINN_000_001","It's the first time I've seen one made from cat's-eye, so the owner shouldn't be hard to track down. I'd go and look for them myself, but I've got too much to do here."
50,"TEXT_LUCKZH001_03511_SVEINN_000_002","Would you be able to go in my place? The graveyard keeper is quite knowledgeable about charms and whatnot, so it might be worth asking him."
51,"TEXT_LUCKZH001_03511_SVEINN_000_010","I can't very well keep it for myself or sell it. For all I know, it could be cursed or something!"
52,"TEXT_LUCKZH001_03511_PRIEST03511_000_020","What's that you have there?"
53,"TEXT_LUCKZH001_03511_PRIEST03511_000_021","Oh, yes. Cat's-eye charms like this were once used to ward off misfortune. The tradition began with the Church of the First Light and the gem represents their patron deity."
54,"TEXT_LUCKZH001_03511_PRIEST03511_000_022","Even though no one follows that old religion anymore, some of its customs remain, especially among the miners."
55,"TEXT_LUCKZH001_03511_PRIEST03511_000_023","You don't see many this exquisite, though. I seem to remember the fellow with an eyepatch kept a similar charm around his neck. It might even be the exact same one."
56,"TEXT_LUCKZH001_03511_PRIEST03511_000_024","I never caught his name, but he's not hard to miss. The last I saw of him, he was leaving to mine Nuvy's Leavings with some of the others."
57,"TEXT_LUCKZH001_03511_SVEINN_000_030","Man with an eyepatch? Yes, I know the one. So you think the charm might be his?"
58,"TEXT_LUCKZH001_03511_PRIEST03511_000_031","I can't say for certain if the man I mentioned is the owner. I have a feeling I saw him wearing that charm, though."
