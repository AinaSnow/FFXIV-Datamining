58,"TEXT_LUCKZI102_03557_RONITT_000_010","Oh, I see. You're thinkin', “He can greet some overgrown toy just fine, but he's too scared to talk to actual people!” You just don't understand me!"

You must be the visitor Xamott was talking about. What can this old lady do for you?"

67,"TEXT_LUCKZI102_03557_XEMUTT_000_030","Poured the lot in then, have you? Thank you, dear. You're as kind as our Ronitt."
68,"TEXT_LUCKZI102_03557_XEMUTT_000_031","When he heard how my back was giving me trouble, that fine young lad went and hammered together my oddly named helper here. Hardly a day goes by when he doesn't stop past to see it's working properly."
69,"TEXT_LUCKZI102_03557_XEMUTT_000_032","Aye, he's a surly boy, but his heart's in the right place."
70,"TEXT_LUCKZI102_03557_XEMUTT_000_033","It's just a pity he handles his failures with frustration..."
71,"TEXT_LUCKZI102_03557_XEMUTT_000_034","If he persevered with his greetings instead of lashing out, I'm sure he'd be capable of a lovely “lali-ho.”"
72,"TEXT_LUCKZI102_03557_XEMUTT_000_035","Actually, I'm surprised he even asked you to bring me my fuel. I've never known him to do that before─not with anyone."
73,"TEXT_LUCKZI102_03557_XEMUTT_000_036","I've a feeling you'll be the one to get through to him, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>, so...be patient, if you can. Thank you again for the delivery!"
74,"TEXT_LUCKZI102_03557_RONITT_000_040","You delivered the coal to Xemutt, then!?"
75,"TEXT_LUCKZI102_03557_RONITT_000_041","Wait! She...she didn't say anythin' strange about me, did she?"
76,"TEXT_LUCKZI102_03557_RONITT_000_042","Anyway...th-thanks for the help. Maybe you and I can be friends after all. “Maybe,” I said!"
