50,"TEXT_LUCKZG025_03510_DRERY_000_002","Anyway, like a lot of miners, my friend kept a will. But she couldn't write a nice, simple one the same as everyone else, oh no."
51,"TEXT_LUCKZG025_03510_DRERY_000_003","It said that she'd buried something and that if we wanted to find it, we'd have to solve a conundrum. Trouble is, none of us can work it out. But I thought someone like you, with an outsider's perspective, might see something we hadn't."
52,"TEXT_LUCKZG025_03510_DRERY_000_004","It goes like this:"

Fear not the fall, look to the Wall,
At the first dry giant's heel, the brave wanderer must kneel."""
54,"TEXT_LUCKZG025_03510_DRERY_000_006","I can't make head nor tail of it, to be honest. Still, we're dying to know what she's buried, so if you have any luck, be sure to tell us. Oh, and I wrote down the riddle, in case you forget."
55,"TEXT_LUCKZG025_03510_SYSTEM_100_006","Use Drery's note to read the riddle again."

64,"TEXT_LUCKZG025_03510_DRERY_000_044","Come to think of it, I knew she made a killing on the cards, but I never saw her spending much of her winnings. Seems she was putting them away to give back to the town after her death, almost like she knew it was coming."
65,"TEXT_LUCKZG025_03510_DRERY_000_045","Always was a mystery, that one. It's funny, I never realized how much I miss her until now. Not only have you solved the riddle, but you've shown me what sort of person she really was. You have my thanks."
