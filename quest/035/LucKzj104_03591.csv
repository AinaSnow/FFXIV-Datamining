Naroshs Koal at last knows what must be done."
1,"TEXT_LUCKZJ104_03591_SEQ_01","The clutchmother's cries grow more desperate, but fortunately you have finally struck upon a viable method: a birthing rope. No rope of ordinary make will suffice, though, for she is far stronger than the average finless one, and so Naroshs Koal implores you to seek out and slay several sea anemones that you might claim their tentacles as material.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_LUCKZJ104_03591_SEQ_02","From each of the anemones you harvest the stoutest tentacles, which will surely serve well as rope. Nevertheless, Naroshs Koal will have to be the judge."
3,"TEXT_LUCKZJ104_03591_SEQ_03","With a glance the young Ondo concludes that the tentacles are perfect. Taking them from your hands, he immediately sets about weaving the birthing rope─a task which leaves him utterly exhausted. It falls to you to deliver it to Xeroshs Ooan, before it is too late."
4,"TEXT_LUCKZJ104_03591_SEQ_04","You arrive in the nick of time, it seems, and after Xeroshs Ooan instructs the clutchmother's attendants in the rope's use, you and he and Naroshs Koal wait with bated breath as the Ondo matron summons her every onze of strength to bring her children into the world. Time passes without word from within, until finally you learn that the clutchmother and her eggs are well. For their loyal service, the two male Ondo are entrusted with an egg each, and though you are offered one as well at first, the clutchmother reconsiders after recognizing that you cannot possibly fertilize it, much less raise the resulting child as your own. Your joint duty complete, the newly named Naroshs Ooan begs a final moment to speak in private."
5,"TEXT_LUCKZJ104_03591_SEQ_05","Naroshs Ooan cannot well express his joy at finally being recognized as a full-fledged adult, worthy of raising a child─and it is all thanks to you. Though he will need to devote his every waking moment to their care for the foreseeable future, he is certain that you will cross paths again, and looks forward to that fateful day."
