49,"TEXT_LUCKZJ013_03576_ONDOPEOPLE03576_000_001","Quite literally, in fact, for I wish to make oranges! So deliciousss are the ones we have purchased from traders, full of surprisingly sssour sweetness!"
50,"TEXT_LUCKZJ013_03576_ONDOPEOPLE03576_000_002","I kept the ssseeds of the one I sssupped upon, and now that the sea has been parted, I can at last try my hand at agricultural endeavors! Or I would...if I knew aught of it. What exactly is agriculture, anyway?"
51,"TEXT_LUCKZJ013_03576_ONDOPEOPLE03576_000_003","So...you bury the seeds in the earth, and with the aid of the sssun's light, it grows into a tree? Not unlike kelp, then? Well! We certainly do not want for earth here, that much I can say."
52,"TEXT_LUCKZJ013_03576_ONDOPEOPLE03576_000_004","We will need a sssubstitute for the sun's light, though. Fortunately, I already have something in mind! Come with me and see for yourself. It is not far─due east of the Cups. Come, come!"
53,"TEXT_LUCKZJ013_03576_ONDOPEOPLE03576_000_010","This is...or was...a variety of feather ssstar─a creature of the sea that shimmers with the radiance of a flower in bloom. Alas, in the absssence of water, it is rather less radiant than I remember..."
54,"TEXT_LUCKZJ013_03576_ONDOPEOPLE03576_000_011","No need to say it. I know this will not do. But worry not! I know of another possible sssolution! Follow me to the northwest, past Where the Dry Return."
55,"TEXT_LUCKZJ013_03576_ONDOPEOPLE03576_000_020","See this white anemone and the ssstarfish which resides above it? Both radiate a gentle light to lure fish that they might feast. Surely this will serve for our purposes?"

57,"TEXT_LUCKZJ013_03576_A1_000_001","Can't say it looks all that promising."

66,"TEXT_LUCKZJ013_03576_ONDOPEOPLE03576_000_031","Huzzah, I knew it! And with a little more light, the oranges will grow as plump and juicy as they would on land!"

69,"TEXT_LUCKZJ013_03576_ONDOPEOPLE03576_000_041","Most Ondo have never known the joy that is a juicy orange, but one day they will! I shall have an orchard, and every Ondo shall feassst on its fruits!"
