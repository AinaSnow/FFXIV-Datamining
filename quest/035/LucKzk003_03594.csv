The patronizing Amaurotine is struggling to conceal their disapproval of your attire."
1,"TEXT_LUCKZK003_03594_SEQ_01","While some might applaud your creative choice of attire, in Amaurot one is best served going about in the traditional robes worn by the vast majority of the citizenry. Fortunately, you need not struggle to fashion your own robes, for the patronizing Amaurotine recalls seeing a gentle soul outside the Hall of Rhetoric who was carrying some perfectly suited for one of your diminutive stature.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_LUCKZK003_03594_SEQ_02","While the gentle Amaurotine was indeed in possession of a spare set of smaller robes, they were the result of a failed attempt to fashion larger ones, and so they summarily disposed of them. If you are to obtain your own, you have no choice but to speak with someone at the Bureau of the Architect and request the appropriate concept."
3,"TEXT_LUCKZK003_03594_SEQ_03","The concept clerk is happy to assist you, but after observing that you are rather lacking in “creative potential,” they declare that you must first use an aetheric rope to capture a weakened cubus. The creature's aetheric energies must be harnessed so that even one of your limited abilities can create their own robes."
4,"TEXT_LUCKZK003_03594_SEQ_04","The cubus is quickly and easily subdued. All that remains is to deliver it to the concept clerk as requested."
5,"TEXT_LUCKZK003_03594_SEQ_05","Your cubus meets with the concept clerk's approval, and you are subsequently furnished with a creation matrix─a crystal inscribed with the robe concept and infused with the necessary energies. With said crystal in hand, any native son or daughter of Amaurot could instinctively create robes for their personal use...but alas, those who cannot be accurately described as such may struggle to utilize the mysterious device as intended..."
