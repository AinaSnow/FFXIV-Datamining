51,"TEXT_LUCKYB002_03598_HALLDOR_000_004","Once upon a time a few perfumed gentlemen were bored out of their wits and desperate for entertainment, and so they pooled their considerable resources and started placing bounties on dangerous beasts to attract hunters."
52,"TEXT_LUCKYB002_03598_HALLDOR_000_005","Their original intent was apparently to derive amusement from the gruesome deaths of those foolish and greedy enough to pursue these marks. A reprehensible pastime, wouldn't you agree?"
53,"TEXT_LUCKYB002_03598_HALLDOR_000_006","But people are stronger and more clever than many realize. Like you─one-nut marks hardly pose a challenge to you now, do they? All the more reason to pester Xylle for permission to take on two-nut bills."
