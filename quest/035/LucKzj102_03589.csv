1,"TEXT_LUCKZJ102_03589_SEQ_01","When he was but a child, Naroshs Koal was washed ashore and would have surely died had a pregnant finless woman not found him and nursed him back to health. Recalling that she spoke of the importance of eating food rich in nutrients, both to heal the body and to nurture the growing life within, the young Ondo would serve the clutchmother a hearty meal, made with the liver of a mnyiri─which he hopes you will procure in his stead.
