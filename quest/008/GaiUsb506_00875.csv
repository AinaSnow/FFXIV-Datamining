1,"TEXT_GAIUSB506_00875_SEQ_01","Barryn's heart is true and swift. Desiring to repay Father Iliud for his kindness, he has saved his gil─and, finding it wanting, enlisted your help. Your task is to raise more funds from both Brother Esmour within the church and Sister Zozoru at Camp Drybone."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSB506_00875_SEQ_02","You receive a sack of gil each from Esmour and Zozoru without a single word of persuasion crossing your lips. In truth, you are slightly piqued, for you had taken some pains to prepare your cajolery. Give the sacks to Ermegarde."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSB506_00875_SEQ_03","The gift is ready, made by Ermegarde's capable hands. Take the cinnamon cookies to Father Iliud at the Church of Saint Adama Landama."

5,"TEXT_GAIUSB506_00875_SEQ_05","You wonder anew at how few the Calamity left untouched. Ever has it been the lot of an obliging stranger to hear confidences from the low and the high, the guarded and the eager. Embrace your destiny."
