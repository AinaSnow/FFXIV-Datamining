0,"TEXT_GAIUSB111_00830_SEQ_00","U'khuba Tia is looking at you with a very cross expression."
1,"TEXT_GAIUSB111_00830_SEQ_01","U'khuba Tia seems ill pleased by your communion with U'tykha Tia, convinced that outsiders should not interfere with U tribe affairs. Carry word of his displeasure to U'tykha Tia."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSB111_00830_SEQ_02","After speaking with U'tykha Tia, you have learned that he is more concerned about the novice U'kahzuna's well-being than he is U'khuba Tia's opinion of him. To ensure that she has not been too wounded by U'khuba Tia's critiques, seek out U'kahzuna in the Minotaur Malm and inquire as to her mental state."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSB111_00830_SEQ_03","You arrive in the Minotaur Malm to find a new U'kahzuna, brimming with vigor. All she seems to require from you are three dune anglers. Proceed into the Sagolii Desert, and use empty angler-sized sacks on them once they have been sufficiently weakened."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSB111_00830_SEQ_04","You are now the proud owner of three sacks full of angry fish monsters. Deliver the catch to U'kahzuna in the Minotaur Malm."
5,"TEXT_GAIUSB111_00830_SEQ_05","A newly serene U'kahzuna has revealed that she is using the enfeebled anglers for archery practice on the advice of U'khuba Tia. Report this astonishing development to U'tykha Tia."
6,"TEXT_GAIUSB111_00830_SEQ_06","U'tykha Tia and U'khuba Tia─surprisingly alike in their devotion to the tribe, but malms apart in all else. Who will become the next nunh, and what will it mean for Forgotten Springs? One thing is for sure: armed with new focus forged by U'tykha Tia and a new weapon furnished by U'khuba Tia, U'kahzuna stalks a brighter future."

56,"TEXT_GAIUSB111_00830_UKHUBATIA_000_001","The fact that U'kahzuna has been naught but a disgrace to us is no excuse for your interference, no matter what U'tykha might believe. For the nonce, I've dispatched her to the Minotaur Malm, that she might reflect on her many flaws in solitude."
57,"TEXT_GAIUSB111_00830_UKHUBATIA_000_002","But that will accomplish nothing by itself. This problem must be fixed at the source: U'tykha's foolish methods.

58,"TEXT_GAIUSB111_00830_UTYKHATIA_000_010","What's all this? U'khuba expects me to stay away from teaching our young ones? His foolish notions truly know no bounds. A true instructor does more than simply criticize his students when they fail."

64,"TEXT_GAIUSB111_00830_UKAHZUNA_000_045","These should do nicely. I switched to archery, you see. And I thought that anglers, a mite slowed, would make fine practice targets. It's interesting... I wouldn't have dreamed of picking up the bow before, but some things became clear to me after that Amalj'aa hunt..."
