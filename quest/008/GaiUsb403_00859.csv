0,"TEXT_GAIUSB403_00859_SEQ_00","Commander Bloeidin has a request of you, and when a Red Swallow asks nicely for something, it is best to oblige. "
1,"TEXT_GAIUSB403_00859_SEQ_01","Bloeidin is concerned about his scouts, who eat far too much weevil and too little meat and fish. Grill them a large trout using the nearby campfire."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSB403_00859_SEQ_02","The fish looks enticingly crispy, a credit to your cooking prowess. Remove it from the fire."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSB403_00859_SEQ_03","You have a grilled warmwater trout of great size, with deliciously singed skin and succulent flesh. You will not see its like again. Give it to the three Red Swallows."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSB403_00859_SEQ_04","Notwithstanding the disheartening lack of three-star reviews, the scouts have been fed. Inform Commander Bloeidin that his troops are satiated."
5,"TEXT_GAIUSB403_00859_SEQ_05","Having spoken with the commander, you find your heart strangely stirred by his words of admiration for his soldiers. While it would have been better manners for the scouts to have exclaimed over the fish, it cannot be expected of former pirates."
