1,"TEXT_GAIUSB607_00889_SEQ_01","As a condition of providing you with three formal introductions to the other three High Houses, Lord Portelaine has asked you to investigate the scene of a recent robbery west of the Observatorium. Search for and recover any parcels that you find, but make sure that you are prepared to defend yourself if the perpetrators are still present."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSB607_00889_SEQ_02","Your search yields three parcels which likely belong to the porter who was ambushed. Present them to Lord Portelaine in exchange for your introductions."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSB607_00889_SEQ_03","Much to your dismay, your arrangement with Lord Portelaine is brushed aside when the Ishgardian discovers a draconian rosary in a chest belonging to Lord Francel of House Haillenarte. As this could be considered proof of heresy, Lord Portelaine advises you against associating with any man of House Haillenarte. As the lord talks of informing the inquisitors, the knight standing behind him locks eyes with you, in an obvious attempt to catch your attention. Perhaps you should take a moment to speak with the grizzled knight."
