1,"TEXT_GAIUSB212_00843_SEQ_01","Shamani Lohmani has suggested that you search for a bottle of Bacchus wine. This popular wine was once abundant in Wineport, but most stores were destroyed during the Calamity. However, rumor has it that one of the resident vignerons may be keeping a secret cache. Speak with the vignerons and see if there is any truth to these tales."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSB212_00843_SEQ_02","Alas, the vignerons reiterate that there is no point in searching for Bacchus wine. You must once again bear the bad news back to Shamani Lohmani."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSB212_00843_SEQ_03","Even though he knew it was a ridiculous idea, Shamani Lohmani is still saddened to hear that no one in town has a bottle of Bacchus wine. He also admits that he has a personal preference for the drink, as it rekindled his love of fine spirits and helped him to find a new direction in life. With both his plans foiled, the blind vintner begins contemplating how to best approach the situation."

49,"TEXT_GAIUSB212_00843_SHAMANILOHMANI_000_001","Alas, the quality of our product has declined significantly in recent years. The only breeds cultivated these days are common lowland vines. Which isn't to say that their grapes are of poor quality─only that we have known better."
50,"TEXT_GAIUSB212_00843_SHAMANILOHMANI_000_002","Long ago, the vignerons of Wineport crossbred several species, and produced a grape-bearing vine of never-before-seen quality."
51,"TEXT_GAIUSB212_00843_SHAMANILOHMANI_000_003","Bacchus grapes were once the pride of this town, as they were used to produce vintages which surpassed all others."

53,"TEXT_GAIUSB212_00843_SHAMANILOHMANI_000_005","Ahem. Pardon my enthusiasm. You see, I once had the privilege to sample that particular wine."
54,"TEXT_GAIUSB212_00843_SHAMANILOHMANI_000_006","It was an otherworldly experience. In that moment, I felt as though I had tasted the nectar of the gods themselves. I transcended my mortal flesh, and was one with all creation."
55,"TEXT_GAIUSB212_00843_SHAMANILOHMANI_000_007","<sigh> But, as is all too often said, the Calamity changed that. The Bacchus vineyards were completely destroyed, along with much of the existing stock of Bacchus wine. What little remains is closely guarded by its owners, for it can no longer be made."
56,"TEXT_GAIUSB212_00843_SHAMANILOHMANI_000_008","If we cannot convince Byrglaent to part with his wines, our next best option─as ridiculous as it sounds─is to find someone who has a bottle of Bacchus wine, and to offer them every gil we can spare. I've heard rumors that one of the vignerons tending the vineyards might have once owned a bottle─perhaps you could start by speaking with them?"
57,"TEXT_GAIUSB212_00843_DURIMFALURIM_000_010","Bacchus wine? Bah, don't remind me─used to have a cellar filled with the stuff! Thought I could keep the wine safe from thieves and the elements. Never counted on a bloody primal blowing up my godsdamned house!"

62,"TEXT_GAIUSB212_00843_SHAMANILOHMANI_000_033","After Titan blinded me in our battle beneath O'Ghomoro, I fell into a deep depression.
