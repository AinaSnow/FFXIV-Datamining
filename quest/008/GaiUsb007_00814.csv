51,"TEXT_GAIUSB007_00814_WHEISKAET_100_002","Naturally, such fine dining must be accompanied with a suitable wine. And by “suitable,” I mean “the very best there is.” That, however, can wait for the time being, as I believe you have enough on your plate as it is."

59,"TEXT_GAIUSB007_00814_LANDENEL_000_024","Will I help you get it? Hah, you amuse me. I will not jeopardize my position by openly assisting you. From me you will receive only information. What you do with it is your choice."
