49,"TEXT_LUCKZA018_03360_THENOISE_000_002","I even worry for my husband taking the road down to the shipyard, and he's as strong as a Talos. He <Emphasis>has</Emphasis> been gone a good while, though... If you're headed that way, could you please let him know his wife is expecting him at home?"
50,"TEXT_LUCKZA018_03360_THENOISE_000_003","My husband went to the shipyard to salvage lumber, but he should have been back by now. If you see a burly man stripping planks from the old ships, please tell him to hurry home..."
51,"TEXT_LUCKZA018_03360_CARPENTER03360_000_010","Eh? Somethin' I can do for you, stranger?"
52,"TEXT_LUCKZA018_03360_CARPENTER03360_000_011","...Well beat me with a hammer, has it been that long!? I was aimin' to salvage the planks from this old hull, but she's givin' me more trouble than I bargained for."
53,"TEXT_LUCKZA018_03360_CARPENTER03360_000_012","Bit of a waste to leave all this lumber lyin' around─not much call for seaworthy ships since the Light ate up half the world, you understand."
54,"TEXT_LUCKZA018_03360_CARPENTER03360_000_013","So I reckoned it were better for a woodworker like me to put it to good use. These boards, though... They're so tightly joined, I can't pull the bleedin' things loose."
55,"TEXT_LUCKZA018_03360_CARPENTER03360_000_014","Here, do me a favor and sprinkle some of this powder on the joints along the keel. I'll keep workin' on this end, and with any luck I can make it home afore the wife stomps down here to fetch me herself."
56,"TEXT_LUCKZA018_03360_CARPENTER03360_000_015","Just a pinch of that powder on each of the keel joints, if you please."
57,"TEXT_LUCKZA018_03360_CARPENTER03360_000_020","That should do the trick! Powdered fire crystal is the best thing for melting wood glue─just pour on a little water and the steam'll take care of the rest!"
58,"TEXT_LUCKZA018_03360_CARPENTER03360_000_021","This ought to be a one-man job now, thanks to you. Oh, and if you could let Thenoise know I'll be done within the hour, then you'll have helped me out of two rough spots today!"
59,"TEXT_LUCKZA018_03360_CARPENTER03360_000_022","Headed back to Wright, friend? I'd appreciate it if you could tell Thenoise I'll be home sooner rather than later."
60,"TEXT_LUCKZA018_03360_THENOISE_000_030","He's alright, then? Well, that's a relief. Wright's had its share of troubles, and a wife does worry..."

62,"TEXT_LUCKZA018_03360_THENOISE_000_032","Still, we're lucky his father taught him the trade at all, even if he uses those skills to take ships apart instead of building them."
63,"TEXT_LUCKZA018_03360_THENOISE_000_033","A woodworker puts food on the table, so I'm grateful to his family for keeping up their traditions."
