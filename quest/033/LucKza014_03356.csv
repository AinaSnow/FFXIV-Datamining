49,"TEXT_LUCKZA014_03356_SERIOUSMAN03356_000_002","There's a bit of a problem, see. We take turns manning the watchtowers hereabouts, but the last few folk have been driven away from the lighthouse post by sudden and terrible headaches."
50,"TEXT_LUCKZA014_03356_SERIOUSMAN03356_000_003","Every single one of them remembers hearing some sort of “screeching wail.” We don't know if we're dealing with a sea witch or a roaming banshee, but they all agree the sound is awful enough to chill your blood!"
51,"TEXT_LUCKZA014_03356_SERIOUSMAN03356_000_004","How fortunate for me, then, that I have you to back me up! Pray follow me to the Clave, and we can solve this mystery together..."
52,"TEXT_LUCKZA014_03356_SERIOUSMAN03356_000_010","Hmph, I don't hear anything..."
53,"TEXT_LUCKZA014_03356_SERIOUSMAN03356_000_011","Maybe we should split up and have more of a look around. Once you're satisfied there's naught to find, you can meet me back here at the lighthouse."
54,"TEXT_LUCKZA014_03356_SYSTEM_000_020","You think you hear a faint noise...but maybe you imagined it."
55,"TEXT_LUCKZA014_03356_SYSTEM_000_021","The waters here swell and crash with cacophonous violence, rivaling the stormy seas of La Noscea..."
56,"TEXT_LUCKZA014_03356_SYSTEM_000_022","You hear nothing but the lapping of the waves..."
57,"TEXT_LUCKZA014_03356_SERIOUSMAN03356_000_030","I heard it...that terrible voice! Aaargh! The pain! I can feel my head...splitting in half..."
58,"TEXT_LUCKZA014_03356_SYSTEM_000_031","The farmer seems to be in no state to talk. Perhaps you can <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>soothe<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> him with a few calming words..."

That keening din seemed to pierce my very skull..."
60,"TEXT_LUCKZA014_03356_SERIOUSMAN03356_000_041","I've never heard the likes of it. If there truly exists a sea witch who murders sailors with her cursed screams, then that is how I imagine her voice would sound."
61,"TEXT_LUCKZA014_03356_SERIOUSMAN03356_000_042","At least now we know which areas are too dangerous to approach. Come, we must return to Wright so I can share this with the others."

65,"TEXT_LUCKZA014_03356_SERIOUSMAN03356_000_051","But not everyone puts stock in those old tales, it seems. There was talk of a girl from Gatetown who's taken to visiting the lighthouse to practice her sing─ Wait... You don't think that awful keening could have been...? No, surely not..."
66,"TEXT_LUCKZA014_03356_SERIOUSMAN03356_000_052","Ahaha...hahaha. Ahem. Thank you for standing by me during that terrifying ordeal. And be wary of wailing sea witches should you find yourself near the Clave again!"
