72,"TEXT_LUCKMB115_03316_WYDLAD_000_055","Ordinarily, when a living being turns into a sin eater, it loses everything about its mind that defined it. However, the king has retained some of their instincts."
73,"TEXT_LUCKMB115_03316_WYDLAD_000_056","This manifests in the desire to play and be free. So strong is that desire, it often leaks through the seal to invade our consciousness."

75,"TEXT_LUCKMB115_03316_WYDLAD_000_058","But forgive me, I was going to thank you for reuniting me with my ink. You did exactly as I asked, so I will give you the service I promised.
...Ahem! Nothing up my sleeve, and...voila! May it serve you well!"
