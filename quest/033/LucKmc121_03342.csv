84,"TEXT_LUCKMC121_03342_ALPHINAUD_000_090","No doubt you all are tired as well, having traveled so far. Why don't we all take a much-needed rest before we discuss our findings?"
85,"TEXT_LUCKMC121_03342_YSHTOLA_000_091","I thought to propose the very same. After your clash with the Warden, you deserve a chance to recuperate."
