And while it is plain we've not seen the last of General Ran'jit, I for one am glad to delay our reckoning with him awhile longer."
49,"TEXT_LUCKMB120_03321_ALISAIE_000_005","It seems I was wrong about your friend. Had Feo Ul not stepped in, you'd be frolicking with the faeries by now."

52,"TEXT_LUCKMB120_03321_THANCRED_000_020","I knew you could do it. And not only because of your blessing. You have a strength all your own, and it has seen us through many a trial."

55,"TEXT_LUCKMB120_03321_THANCRED_000_023","Now then, I suggest we hurry back to the Crystarium. Much and more may have happened while we were frolicking with the fae folk."
56,"TEXT_LUCKMB120_03321_THANCRED_000_024","That Ran'jit elected to pursue us makes me hopeful the city was spared Eulmore's attentions, but I would sooner see for myself."
