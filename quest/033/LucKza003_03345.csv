48,"TEXT_LUCKZA003_03345_DARLFORT_000_000","Good morrow, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>ma'am<Else/>sir</If>. I'm terribly sorry to ask this of a patron, but could you perchance find the time to make a delivery for me?"
49,"TEXT_LUCKZA003_03345_DARLFORT_000_001","Just yesterday, you see, a customer─not a regular, I believe he's visiting from outside the Crystarium─came asking after a particularly strong spirit that we're known to serve. At the time, we had just run out, but I offered that our supplier would have more ready today."
50,"TEXT_LUCKZA003_03345_DARLFORT_000_002","He told me that that would be fine, but that he would require it be delivered to his lodgings. He then paid quite a handsome sum in advance...before consuming more than a half-dozen pints of ale in short order and wandering off."
51,"TEXT_LUCKZA003_03345_DARLFORT_000_003","The whole experience was incredibly odd. I do, of course, fully intend to provide him with the alcohol that he paid for─but I also cannot help but be concerned by his behavior. It seems to me that someone ought to check on him."
52,"TEXT_LUCKZA003_03345_DARLFORT_000_004","Alas, between brewing and serving the customers, I can't seem to find time to slip away. Could I impose upon you to deliver the liquor in my stead, and inquire as to whether the man is quite well?"
53,"TEXT_LUCKZA003_03345_DARLFORT_100_004","Eidith should have the alcohol in question ready at Musica Universalis. And as for our eccentric patron─you will find him at the Catenaries, assuming he gave me the correct information."
54,"TEXT_LUCKZA003_03345_DARLFORT_000_005","By his conduct, I cannot help but wonder─no, best not to speculate."
55,"TEXT_LUCKZA003_03345_EIDITH_000_010","Here on behalf of Darlfort? Aye, I have the liquor right here."
56,"TEXT_LUCKZA003_03345_EIDITH_000_011","You'll be delivering this to a customer at the Catenaries, right? In that case, you'd do well to speak with the manager there. He's a helpful sort─should make sure it gets to the right person."
57,"TEXT_LUCKZA003_03345_EIDITH_000_012","Tell Darlfort I appreciate the business, as always."
58,"TEXT_LUCKZA003_03345_ATTENDANT03345_000_020","How might I be of service?"
59,"TEXT_LUCKZA003_03345_ATTENDANT03345_000_021","Ah, I see. That guest is somewhat...indisposed, I'm afraid to say. But I will ensure that the liquor is delivered into his hands, if you will entrust it to me."
60,"TEXT_LUCKZA003_03345_ATTENDANT03345_000_022","As to his condition─it does seem to be rather severe. His cries echoed through the corridors late into the evening."
61,"TEXT_LUCKZA003_03345_ATTENDANT03345_000_023","Judging by what I have glimpsed, I fear that it is a mere matter of time ere he turns..."
62,"TEXT_LUCKZA003_03345_ATTENDANT03345_000_024","But you need not concern yourself with that. Rest assured that we have matters well in hand here."
63,"TEXT_LUCKZA003_03345_ATTENDANT03345_000_025","I will see to it that the alcohol reaches the intended recipient with all haste."
64,"TEXT_LUCKZA003_03345_DARLFORT_000_030","A matter of time before he turns, you say... I suppose that does explain it."
65,"TEXT_LUCKZA003_03345_DARLFORT_000_031","It's hardly a wonder that he turned to drink, I'm sure you would agree. In the throes of such agony and despair...what is a man to do?"
66,"TEXT_LUCKZA003_03345_DARLFORT_000_032","I know not if it will bring him solace, in the end... But nevertheless, I thank you for making the delivery. "
