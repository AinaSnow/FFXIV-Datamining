Eueliss appears determined to complete the last of Sai-Lewq's tasks."
1,"TEXT_LUCKZA103_03373_SEQ_01","Eueliss stands before Sai-Lewq once again, and indicates her willingness to complete his tasks. This time, the old man sends you off to the cape known as “the Split Hull” to gather a bouquet for his beloved wife...

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_LUCKZA103_03373_SEQ_02","After arriving at the Split Hull, Eueliss confirms what you already suspected: Sai-Lewq's wife did not survive the eater attack a year ago. She nevertheless bids you seek out the prettiest blooms to offer as a tribute to the deceased."
3,"TEXT_LUCKZA103_03373_SEQ_03","Careful not to trample the delicate plants, you pick a selection of brightly colored flowers to hand over to Eueliss."
4,"TEXT_LUCKZA103_03373_SEQ_04","Eueliss accepts your contribution to the bouquet, commending you on your choice of flowers. Now to deliver the blooms to Sai-Lewq back at Stonegazer..."
5,"TEXT_LUCKZA103_03373_SEQ_05","Sai-Lewq accepts the bouquet with a smile, but his joyful expression swiftly crumbles as the reality of his wife's death comes crashing down upon him. He apologizes for his cruelly insensitive requests, and explains how despair had driven him to embrace a destructive fantasy. Eueliss, however, soon forgives him, understanding his pain only too well. Wordlessly, you watch over them, giving the two a moment to gather themselves for the hard decisions which lie ahead..."

50,"TEXT_LUCKZA103_03373_SAILEWQ_000_002","Just one last thing... I want you to gather some pretty flowers from the Split Hull as a gift for my darling wife."
51,"TEXT_LUCKZA103_03373_SAILEWQ_000_003","She went out for her usual walk, but has not yet deigned to come home. I fear I may have said something to sour her mood..."

53,"TEXT_LUCKZA103_03373_EUELISS_000_005","Well, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Will you accompany me to the cape for some flower picking?"

55,"TEXT_LUCKZA103_03373_EUELISS_000_010","This is almost pleasant, isn't it? Aside from the aggressive wildlife, of course."
56,"TEXT_LUCKZA103_03373_EUELISS_000_011","...I should tell you about Sai-Lewq's wife. She was killed in the eater incident, although I imagine you already suspected as much."
57,"TEXT_LUCKZA103_03373_EUELISS_000_012","They made such a sweet couple. Every day they would walk up this cape, hand in hand, and she would gaze out over the flowers with this warm, contented smile..."
58,"TEXT_LUCKZA103_03373_EUELISS_000_013","Sai-Lewq himself has some training as a warrior. He would guard her as if she were a princess, and he her gallant knight... <sob> I'm sorry, it's just... <sniff>"

But I succeeded only in hurting those around me..."

82,"TEXT_LUCKZA103_03373_SAILEWQ_000_041","You always were such a sweet child. I will place the flowers you brought on her grave─she would have loved them."
83,"TEXT_LUCKZA103_03373_SAILEWQ_000_042","As for me assuming the role of mayor... I am sorry, but I cannot give you a decision just yet."
84,"TEXT_LUCKZA103_03373_EUELISS_000_041","Take as long as you need. In fact, I might need a little time to recover myself."
