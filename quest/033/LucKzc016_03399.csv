Why, he's half-buried in mountains of tomes and other things I have no name for, and as a result he spends half his time searching for things. Which means less time playing with us!"
50,"TEXT_LUCKZC016_03399_PIXIE03399_000_002","What I want to do is cast an enchantment on his tomes so he can find them easily. All he has to do is say a tome's name, and it will come flying into his hands! Brilliant, yes?"
51,"TEXT_LUCKZC016_03399_PIXIE03399_000_003","The problem is, I can't read your funny mortal letters, meaning I can't find his favorite tomes. So I need you to do the finding and the enchanting in my stead."

One is about the history of Voeburt, another about some Shadowkeeper person, and the last about runes, the letters we use in our language. Please find each of them and give them a good sprinkling of these flying fishscales!"

57,"TEXT_LUCKZC016_03399_BOOKA03399_000_012","Ere such an alliance could be forged, however, much blood was spilled. In order to avoid further bloodshed, our ancestors established a system of succession whereby the crown would be retained by the Drahn."
