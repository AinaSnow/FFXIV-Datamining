Ghun Gun can barely contain his excitement at the prospect of yet more digging."
1,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_SEQ_01","Ghun Gun is champing at the proverbial bit at the mere thought of unearthing more artifacts discarded by the Nabaath. Following their estimated route across the desert, Jamial leads the way west towards the Nabaath Severance, where the last excavation point is situated.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_SEQ_02","Ghun Gun's fervent scrabbling reveals a cylindrical container beneath the sand. He turns to offer the relic to Jamial, only to discover that your elderly companion has mysteriously disappeared."
3,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_SEQ_03","Despite being in the midst of a vast, open desert, Jamial is nowhere to be seen. Ghun Gun suggests looking from a higher vantage point while he stays behind to guard the treasure."
4,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_SEQ_04","Jamial's trail has gone cold, the desert winds having blown away any footprints he may have left. With no other recourse, you return to Ghun Gun to share these ill tidings."
5,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_SEQ_05","While you were searching for your missing companion, Ghun Gun has been inspecting the treasure he had found earlier, which contained a Nabaath royal family tree. One name in particular stands out among the list of monarchs: Jamial. Ghun Gun, never one to let logic cloud his judgment, jumps to the conclusion that the elderly man with whom you have been traveling must therefore be a ghost of a dead malik, who, satisfied by the discovery of the lost relics, has now passed on to the afterlife, hence his sudden disappearance. Believing that ghosts are plaguing Amh Araeng, he asks that you go with him and report the matter to his father."
6,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_SEQ_06","In the midst of explaining your findings to Ghen Gen, you are interrupted by the arrival of Jamial, who is in fact not a ghost after all, much to the surprise of Ghun Gun. The elderly archaeologist reveals that he was named after his grandfather, Jamial IX, the last malik of the Nabaath, and that he wishes to recover their treasures. Ghun Gun is also eager to learn more of his own people's past, and expresses his desire to assist Jamial in further expeditions. As the pair leave to discuss their next outing, Ghen Gen thanks you in their stead for your contributions towards discovering the lost history of Amh Araeng."

50,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_JAMIAL_000_011","West from here, close to the Nabaath Severance."
51,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_GHUNGUN_000_012","Then what are we waiting for? Must hurry, must hurry!"
52,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_JAMIAL_000_020","Yes, this is the spot. Let us see what we can find here."

57,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_JAMIAL_000_033","Why do you go to such lengths to help me? You have had barely a moment's rest since we first began, yet you set about your digging like a man possessed."

73,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_GHUNGUN_000_082","While you were gone, I inspected the treasure."

89,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_JAMIAL_000_108","So you came to the conclusion that I was a ghost of the last malik, on the basis that we have the same name? Perhaps we had best put this misunderstanding down to an overactive imagination..."
90,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_JAMIAL_100_109","Jamial IX, the last malik, was my grandfather. I was named after him, which makes me Jamial X."
91,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_GHUNGUN_000_109","So you are Nabaath royalty!? It all makes sense now... I think. But why did you disappear like that?"
92,"TEXT_LUCKZA204_03378_JAMIAL_000_110","I tried to tell you that I was going to return to Mord Souq to prepare your reward, though it seems that you did not hear me. All of that scrabbling around in the dirt must have drowned out my voice..."
