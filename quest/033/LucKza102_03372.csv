Eueliss appears ready to accept Sai-Lewq's next task."
1,"TEXT_LUCKZA102_03372_SEQ_01","Eueliss asks Sai-Lewq for his second task─a duty which apparently involves a slow-footed Talos. Follow her lead, and help free the Talos in question from any bothersome predators.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_LUCKZA102_03372_SEQ_02","You have inspected the derelict Talos, and dealt with the pests which infested its interior. Eueliss waits nearby with a look of resignation..."
3,"TEXT_LUCKZA102_03372_SEQ_03","Eueliss briefly explains the decline of Talos in the region, and how the rusted specimen you inspected─a favorite of Sai-Lewq's─was damaged to the point where it would never move again. With nothing more to be done, you turn back towards Stonegazer."
4,"TEXT_LUCKZA102_03372_SEQ_04","Sai-Lewq appears well pleased by your actions in aiding his dear Talos. Eueliss, too, thanks you for your assistance, and hopes that you will stay to help with whatever other confounding errands the old man has in store."

51,"TEXT_LUCKZA102_03372_SAILEWQ_000_003","There's a Talos of mine that's taking far too long to make its return. Probably busy tussling with some dim-witted predator. Go and see how it fares, and chase off anything slowing it down."

56,"TEXT_LUCKZA102_03372_SYSTEM_110_010","Something hostile emerges from the Talos!"
57,"TEXT_LUCKZA102_03372_EUELISS_100_010","Here's the Talos Sai-Lewq was talking about. I think something's made a nest in there..."
58,"TEXT_LUCKZA102_03372_EUELISS_000_010","Phew, I'm glad you were here! They must have burrowed in beneath the plates."
59,"TEXT_LUCKZA102_03372_EUELISS_000_011","I know Sai-Lewq implied the Talos was still moving, but as you can see..."
60,"TEXT_LUCKZA102_03372_EUELISS_000_012","Once upon a time there'd be a line of these contraptions hauling materials down to the shipyard, step by ponderous step. Which incidentally, is how the “Slowroad” supposedly earned its name."
61,"TEXT_LUCKZA102_03372_EUELISS_000_013","But after Daedalus Stoneworks closed down some fifteen summers ago, there was no one left to make or maintain their creations. One by one, the Talos slowly fell into disrepair..."
