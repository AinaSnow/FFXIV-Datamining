For the creatures which then did rise from that fulgent deluge were seen as agents of divine punishment, sent to devour sin and sinner both─whence came the name of “sin eater.”"

55,"TEXT_LUCKMC102_03323_URIANGER_000_012","Yet where there is light, there hath ever been shade, and 'twas in the dark they sought solace."
56,"TEXT_LUCKMC102_03323_URIANGER_000_013","The most devout of these worshipers of shadow did then migrate to the Rak'tika Greatwood. But that is a tale for another time."

66,"TEXT_LUCKMC102_03323_URIANGER_000_045","...And its followers did want for places of worship. To be plain, the standards which do adorn these walls belong not to those who built them, but to worshipers of the Dark─the Night's Blessed."
