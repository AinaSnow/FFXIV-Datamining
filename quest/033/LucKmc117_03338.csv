57,"TEXT_LUCKMC117_03338_UIMET_000_025","The Eulmoran soldiers and the Children have fled Yx'Maja."
58,"TEXT_LUCKMC117_03338_UIMET_000_026","They abandoned Slitherbough as well, though they yet remain in the swamps near Lakeland."
59,"TEXT_LUCKMC117_03338_UIMET_000_027","Unfortunately, a number of the Blessed were poisoned while fending off the soldiers."

63,"TEXT_LUCKMC117_03338_THANCRED_000_031","Then we must act quickly. If you've a spare vial, Minfilia and I can deliver it to the Blessed at Slitherbough."
64,"TEXT_LUCKMC117_03338_THANCRED_000_032","You and Urianger should return to Fanow and tend to the wounded villager there."

76,"TEXT_LUCKMC117_03338_URIANGER_000_060","Quickly, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I fear he hath precious little time."
