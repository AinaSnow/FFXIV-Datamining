51,"TEXT_LUCKZC004_03387_ROITATCH_000_021","Jests aside, you do us a great service. We were fortunate when a merchant caravan en route to Amh Araeng decided to sojourn here at the Round for a spell. We were able to restock all manner of supplies that we'd been short on for months."
52,"TEXT_LUCKZC004_03387_ROITATCH_000_022","That's how the supply chain works in these parts: caravans pass through bound for far-flung locales, we restock supplies as best we can, and then we ship them out to outposts across Lakeland."
53,"TEXT_LUCKZC004_03387_ROITATCH_000_023","'Course, we don't always have enough free hands to make the deliveries. That's why we're most obliged to the kindness of strangers like yourself. Anyhow, I won't keep you any longer. Be safe on the road, friend."
54,"TEXT_LUCKZC004_03387_ROITATCH_000_031","Decided to stay with us a while longer? If you like this dreary place so much, perhaps you'd be interested in trading places? Ahaha, but I jest─once again, much obliged for your help with the delivery, friend."

57,"TEXT_LUCKZC004_03387_TEANNA_000_042","I suppose I should have been able to tell by your...unconventional garb. Anyhow, rest assured that I got a good tongue-lashing for my presumptuousness. I won't let it happen again."
58,"TEXT_LUCKZC004_03387_TEANNA_000_043","That said, I <Emphasis>am</Emphasis> most grateful for your service─you're a damn sight more useful than half of the men here.
