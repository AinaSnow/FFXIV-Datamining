49,"TEXT_LUCKZA026_03368_GUARD03368_000_001","I'm not sure if that includes the supernatural, but walking corses known as ghilman have been running amok outside of the south entrance. They grab anyone who wanders too close, and drag them under the sand."
50,"TEXT_LUCKZA026_03368_GUARD03368_000_002","I almost fell victim to them myself, and I was lucky to escape. Thing is, I dropped my mother's pendant as I fled, and I'll do anything to get it back. She was a patient here, you see, and it's all I have to remember her by."
51,"TEXT_LUCKZA026_03368_GUARD03368_000_003","Luckily, we've found that enchanted darts shot from a blowgun send the ghilman back to whichever hell they crawled from."
52,"TEXT_LUCKZA026_03368_GUARD03368_000_004","My plan is to rush in and grab the pendant, while you shoot those undead bastards from a distance. So, will you help me?"

54,"TEXT_LUCKZA026_03368_GUARD03368_100_010","I'm fairly certain I dropped the pendant by those ruins over there. As soon as I've found it, I'll race back to the inn. In the meantime, I'll need you to keep the ghilman off my back. Here goes nothing!"
55,"TEXT_LUCKZA026_03368_SYSTEM_200_010","If any ghilman appear, shoot them with the enchanted darts. You may move the camera, as well as zoom in and out.

57,"TEXT_LUCKZA026_03368_GUARD03368_000_021","Do you know, I've never seen such fine aim with a blowgun. The secret, though, lies in the darts. They were excavated from the ruins of Nabaath Areng."
58,"TEXT_LUCKZA026_03368_GUARD03368_000_022","According to the historians, these same darts were used by the Nabaath to destroy ghilman all those years ago. There were whole stockpiles of the things, in fact."
