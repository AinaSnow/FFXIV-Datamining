1,"TEXT_LUCKMA401_03300_SEQ_01","Having listened intently to your experiences with the Leveilleur twins, the Exarch reveals the existence of powerful beings known as Lightwardens, whose destruction he believes is necessary to save the First and avert the Eighth Umbral Calamity. Soon after, your discussion is interrupted by a breathless Captain Lyna, who reports that a nearby town─Holminster Switch─has come under attack by a swarm of sin eaters. The Exarch quickly issues commands, and requests that you assist in the settlement's defense."
2,"TEXT_LUCKMA401_03300_SEQ_02","After you agree to lend your aid, the Exarch urges you to make swift preparations, and meet him at the crossroads north of the Accensor Gate."
3,"TEXT_LUCKMA401_03300_SEQ_03","You rendezvous with the Exarch outside the Crystarium, and he gives you directions to the Northern Staging Point. Time is of the essence."
4,"TEXT_LUCKMA401_03300_SEQ_04","You arrive at the woods on the outskirts of town, where Captain Lyna briefs you on the situation. Considering the number of sin eaters involved, it seems likely that a Lightwarden leads the attack. Make preparations to enter Holminster Switch and slay the abomination!

※Use the Duty Finder if you wish to complete the instance alongside fellow players."
5,"TEXT_LUCKMA401_03300_SEQ_05","You battle your way through the besieged town and put down the Lightwarden raging at its center. At this, the remaining eaters scatter to the winds, leaving you free to withdraw to the Northern Staging Point."
6,"TEXT_LUCKMA401_03300_SEQ_06","The Exarch stands firm as the defeated Warden dissolves into aether, his gaze fixed upon you as you absorb the energy it releases without apparent ill effect. Moments later, the blazing sky dims, night descends, and the Crystarium's exultant steward praises you to the now-starry heavens."
7,"TEXT_LUCKMA401_03300_SEQ_07","Returned to the staging point with the remaining villagers, you have a moment to appreciate the sight of Lakeland beneath a night sky. The Exarch once more exults in your victory, but it seems that you have won only the first battle of many in the war against the sin eaters."

56,"TEXT_LUCKMA401_03300_MYSTERYVOICE_000_031","What can we expect inside, Captain?"
57,"TEXT_LUCKMA401_03300_LYNA_000_032","The town is beset by a swarm unlike any we have seen in recent years. We did our best to evacuate the villagers, but as many as half remain..."
58,"TEXT_LUCKMA401_03300_LYNA_000_033","Judging by the number of eaters present, we have good reason to believe that a Lightwarden leads the attack."
59,"TEXT_LUCKMA401_03300_ALISAIE_000_034","How convenient. It seems we'll have our chance to slay a Warden sooner than we expected."

63,"TEXT_LUCKMA401_03300_MYSTERYVOICE_000_038","Ah, well you can leave that particular quandary to us. I must ask that the guard stand down and allow us to engage this leader of eaters alone."

66,"TEXT_LUCKMA401_03300_LYNA_000_041","...Understood, my lord. As captain of the guard, however, I will not watch you brave such danger without an escort from our ranks. I insist that I go with you."
67,"TEXT_LUCKMA401_03300_MYSTERYVOICE_000_042","Very well. Then our Warden-slaying party shall include myself, the Leveilleurs, Captain Lyna, and last but not least..."

77,"TEXT_LUCKMA401_03300_ALPHINAUD_000_050","As you may have deduced, the “troublesome quality” of the Wardens which I endeavored to raise earlier was this confounded capacity for spontaneous rebirth..."

79,"TEXT_LUCKMA401_03300_ALISAIE_000_055","I can't help but wonder if the scale of this raid is related to the “recruiting” the eaters were doing in Amh Araeng."
