77,"TEXT_LUCKMC104_03325_RUNAR_000_047","In a word, yes. But fear not, it is not too involved."
78,"TEXT_LUCKMC104_03325_RUNAR_000_048","Let us begin with something simple. Follow me."
79,"TEXT_LUCKMC104_03325_RYNE_000_050","I thought Master Matoya kept her room dark because she didn't need the light, but they're all like hers, aren't they..."

88,"TEXT_LUCKMC104_03325_RUNAR_000_081","And with that, you have been cleansed of the Light's blighted touch. How do you feel?"
89,"TEXT_LUCKMC104_03325_RYNE_000_082","I'm not sure, to be honest. Not refreshed, exactly, but I do feel different."
90,"TEXT_LUCKMC104_03325_RYNE_000_083","Has this water been treated in some way?"
91,"TEXT_LUCKMC104_03325_RUNAR_000_084","Only blessed by our priests. They are practiced in the arcane arts. As such, it is said their prayers imbue the water with a faint dark energy."
92,"TEXT_LUCKMC104_03325_RUNAR_000_085","A prickling sensation? No one has ever spoken of such a reaction before."
93,"TEXT_LUCKMC104_03325_RYNE_000_086","I wouldn't say it was an unpleasant sensation, but I too felt something strange."
94,"TEXT_LUCKMC104_03325_RUNAR_000_087","Hmmm. The dark aspect of this water should have no discernible effect. Unless..."
95,"TEXT_LUCKMC104_03325_RUNAR_000_088","By the gods! Master Matoya was right─you <Emphasis>are</Emphasis> sin eaters!"
96,"TEXT_LUCKMC104_03325_RUNAR_000_089","I jest, I jest. What you felt was likely no more than the chill of the water."
97,"TEXT_LUCKMC104_03325_RUNAR_000_090","Perhaps now would be a good time for you to acquaint yourselves with the people of Slitherbough."
98,"TEXT_LUCKMC104_03325_RUNAR_000_091","For that, I must teach you a customary greeting."
