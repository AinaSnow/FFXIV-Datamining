82,"TEXT_LUCKMC111_03332_YSHTOLA_000_042","However, the entrance is seemingly protected by a subtle locking mechanism rooted in the symbolism of Ronkan culture."
83,"TEXT_LUCKMC111_03332_YSHTOLA_000_043","The Ronkans sought to live in harmony with nature, and considered certain animals to be sacred. Foremost in their pantheon was the snake, portrayed as the protector of the wood, and arbiter of life and death. Below it were four others, each equal in rank: the coeurl, the colibri, the opo-opo, and the wolf, characterized as the bringers of liberty, words, enlightenment, and harmony, respectively."
84,"TEXT_LUCKMC111_03332_YSHTOLA_000_044","To open the chamber containing the seal, the tablet states that one must pay due deference to three of these beasts by placing one's palm on monuments wrought in their image, and that this must be done in a specific sequence."
85,"TEXT_LUCKMC111_03332_YSHTOLA_000_045","If my interpretation is correct, the order can be discerned from the three commandments which follow."
86,"TEXT_LUCKMC111_03332_YSHTOLA_000_046","“Give praise unto the snake. By its strength do our lands prosper.”"

89,"TEXT_LUCKMC111_03332_YSHTOLA_000_049","The tablet says naught of the placement, size, or appearance of the monuments, alas. Hopefully all will become clear when you reach the bottom of the lake. Go safely."
