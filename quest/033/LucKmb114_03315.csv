50,"TEXT_LUCKMB114_03315_YSGYUF_000_002","We would tend to them with magicks, except they leave behind a harmful ash. We've no choice but to pluck them one at a time."

61,"TEXT_LUCKMB114_03315_YSGYUF_000_051","Excellent! No more poisonous spores irritating our noses, for a little while at least!"
62,"TEXT_LUCKMB114_03315_YSGYUF_000_052","Oh dear, I believe I'm getting sentimental. Having a patron again...it reminds me of the old days. Fair every day, I would carry my wares to the castle to offer in exchange for men's patronage."
63,"TEXT_LUCKMB114_03315_YSGYUF_000_053","Back then the castle wasn't called Lyhe Ghiah. The Voeburtites built it, and they named it Gruenes Licht."

66,"TEXT_LUCKMB114_03315_YSGYUF_000_056","And if you desire anything else I possess, I would be glad to offer them to you─for a fitting price, of course!"

68,"TEXT_LUCKMB114_03315_YSGYUF_000_058","Now, will you be offering your patronage to anyone else? If so, would you consider Wyd Lad?"
