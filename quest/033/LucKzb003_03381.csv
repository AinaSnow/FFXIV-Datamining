51,"TEXT_LUCKZB003_03381_SUPPLYOFFICER03881_000_002","Ahem. In short, I need you to meet me at the Northern Staging Point. Please."
52,"TEXT_LUCKZB003_03381_SUPPLYOFFICER03881_000_010","We'll be assessing the situation out here. Though it may save time if you were to first tell me what destruction you personally witnessed?"
53,"TEXT_LUCKZB003_03381_SUPPLYOFFICER03881_000_011","Many structures burned or otherwise damaged in the fighting... Yes, I thought as much. I may look into procuring tents so that the laborers come to assist in the reconstruction need not journey back and forth each day─that ought to save time."
54,"TEXT_LUCKZB003_03381_SUPPLYOFFICER03881_000_012","I'd be curious to know whether anything out here actually has survived. Might I ask you to survey the northern area and tell me if you find any materiel or other supplies that might still be fit for use?"

The weapons are less immediately useful, though I will of course have them collected. It seems that I'll primarily need to order tools, as there were none to be found in the areas I checked, either."
