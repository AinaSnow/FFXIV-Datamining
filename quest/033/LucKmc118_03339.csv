52,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_URIANGER_000_030","Could it truly be within his power to pluck Y'shtola from the Lifestream as he claimeth? 'Tis a feat beyond even the greatest practitioners of the arcane. Yet if he would attempt it, we cannot well stand in his way."

54,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_ALMET_000_040","I confess, I do not fully understand what is happening here─but I gather we were right to bring this man to you."
55,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_UIMET_000_045","We found him asleep in the shade of a tree near the ruins. A fine way to behave when one's companions are in dire straits."
56,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_CYMET_000_050","I am relieved to know he is an acquaintance of yours. Though I see you are not close. If he should displease you, we would be happy to deal with him..."
57,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_EMETSELCH_000_060","Now then, if I'm to fetch her for you, I will require a suitable place to work. We must find somewhere that resonates strongly with the Lifestream."

72,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_RYNE_000_100","Urianger once told me that being immersed in the Lifestream can cause irreparable harm to the body. Do you suppose Y'shtola is all right?"

78,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_CYMET_000_125","It was fate who brought you to us, and fate who returned your companion to you. She yet smiles on Ronka, I am sure of it."
79,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_EMETSELCH_000_130","What a touching reunion that was. It fair brought a tear to the eye. But as we both know, such tender moments are nothing if not <Emphasis>momentary</Emphasis>."

86,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_EMETSELCH_000_134","But seriously, we Ascians do what we do for the greater good. For the Rejoining."
87,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_EMETSELCH_000_135","Though we may sow the seeds of chaos, it is man who tends them, he who reaps their bountiful harvest."
88,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_EMETSELCH_000_136","But I grow tired of these arguments. If you would kindly refrain from retorting and return to your customary brooding silence, I will take it as thanks for rescuing your companion and leave it at that."
89,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_EMETSELCH_000_137","Now, we mustn't keep your friends waiting."
90,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_EMETSELCH_000_140","I told you, I tire of these inane arguments. Shouldn't you be getting ready to slay the next Lightwarden or something?"
91,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_YSHTOLA_000_150","My apologies for having put you all through such an ordeal. I could see no other way to save the Night's Blessed. Happily, both they and I yet live─thanks to you."
92,"TEXT_LUCKMC118_03339_YSHTOLA_000_151","But our work here is not yet done. We must make ready to enter the Qitana Ravel, and put the Lightwarden to the sword."
