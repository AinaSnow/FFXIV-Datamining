91,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_KORILLE_000_092","It was the Warden you wished to know about, yes? My mother─may she rest in peace─told me once of its appearance in these woods."
92,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_KORILLE_000_093","Before settling here in Fanow, she lived in a village near Rak'tika Falls─until it was destroyed by the sin eaters."
93,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_KORILLE_000_094","While out on patrol one day, she spotted a swarm of the abominations, one of which was different from the rest."
94,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_KORILLE_000_095","It was larger, for one thing, but what struck her was the way its fellows seemed to revere it. She was convinced that what she had seen was the Lightwarden."
95,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_SYSTEM_000_096","Your exchange with Korille has taught you something about the Lightwarden's possible whereabouts."

98,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_NYMET_000_099","Unfortunately the answer is no, I have not seen the Lightwarden. I patrol the ruins' perimeter regularly, and if it were hiding nearby, I would know about it."
99,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_NYMET_000_100","I apologize that I cannot be of more help, but I have told you all I know."
100,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_LOYMET_000_101","You search for the Lightwarden? I cannot say I have ever laid eyes on it."
101,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_LOYMET_000_102","Our duty is to protect the ruins, nothing more. We have no need to strike out in search of such a foe."
102,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_LOYMET_000_103","I see no reason to pursue one who poses no threat to the ruins."
103,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_SHOINA_000_104","The Lightwarden? No, I have not seen it."
104,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_SHOINA_000_105","But I have witnessed the horrors of the lesser eaters. How they are wont to hunt in packs and carry off their victims rather than consuming them on the spot."
105,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_SHOINA_000_106","I suspect the Warden is a grotesque, corpulent thing, waiting patiently for its minions to bring its next meal."
106,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_SHOINA_000_107","I have not seen the Lightwarden, and I pray I never do."
107,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_THANCRED_000_110","No one I spoke to had seen hide nor hair of the Warden. But that may not be surprising, given their disinclination to stray far from the ruins."
108,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_RYNE_000_115","Did you have any luck speaking with the Viis?"
109,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_URIANGER_000_120","Myriad are the tales the Viis did share with me. Alas, none made mention of the Warden or its lair."

112,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_ALMET_000_131","Near Rak'tika Falls!? Why was I not told of this?"
113,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_UIMET_000_132","I think I see now why it has never been spotted on our patrols."
114,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_YSHTOLA_000_133","I have never heard of this Rak'tika Falls. I can but assume it lies deep within the woods of Yx'Maja."
115,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_CYMET_000_134","Just so. But the tunnel which leads there collapsed after a rather bloody battle with the eaters, and has not been passable for many years."
116,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_CYMET_000_135","We made several attempts to clear away the rubble, yet each time we were driven back. In the end, we were forced to give it up as lost."
117,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_ALMET_000_136","...Thereby making it a suitable place for the Warden to take sanctuary."
118,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_ALMET_000_137","There is perhaps one way to enter. Though it would be at great peril to you and your companions."
119,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_ALMET_000_138","The Qitana Ravel, a temple to the northeast."
120,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_ALMET_000_139","It has been sealed for centuries, but within is a path that leads to the falls."
121,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_YSHTOLA_000_140","Can it be opened?"
122,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_ALMET_000_141","For the allies of Ronka, it can."
123,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_ALMET_000_142","First we must go to the K'mul Astropolis. Once the flow of magic is restored there, the path through the Qitana Ravel can be opened."
124,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_UIMET_000_143","This may sound a simple task, but there are certain...obstacles which prevent us from attending to it ourselves."
125,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_UIMET_000_144","...And we know not how to overcome them."
126,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_CYMET_000_145","The emperor never granted our forebears leave to look upon the secrets we are charged with protecting. That we might not be tempted, the means to do so were withheld from us."
127,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_CYMET_000_146","We can but show you the way. The rest will be up to you."
128,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_YSHTOLA_000_147","It would seem we have our work cut out for us, then. Shall we?"
129,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_Q1_000_000","What will you say?"
130,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_A1_000_001","Did you have to ask?"

132,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_A1_000_003","If we must."

134,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_ALMET_000_149","If that is your wish, it is my duty to escort you."
135,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_YSHTOLA_000_150","While we attend to matters at the K'mul Astropolis, I would ask that your sisters accompany Urianger and Thancred, and share with them all they can of these woods."
136,"TEXT_LUCKMC113_03334_YSHTOLA_000_151","While we have every intention of investigating Rak'tika Falls, 'tis yet possible the Lightwarden dwells elsewhere."
