3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ007_01732_SEQ_03","Noirterel explains that, as a key strategic location, Falcon's Nest must withstand some of the Horde's most vicious attacks. These onslaughts take the form of both direct, frontal assaults and long, drawn-out sieges. The meat you recovered will be frozen and stored for use as emergency rations in the event that supply lines are severed."
