My memory's a bit hazy, but if it really <Emphasis>was</Emphasis> dragons I seen, we could all be in danger. I can't very well go back there by myself, but, well...
I almost hate to ask, but do you think you could traipse on over to the ruins for me? I'll mark down the area I was wanderin' around in on your map."
