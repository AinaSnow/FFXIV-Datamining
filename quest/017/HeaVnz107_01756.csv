1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ107_01756_SEQ_01","Unable to make neither heads nor tails of the bone, Gildon asks you to show it to others in the hopes that they might offer some insight into its meaning. Present the bone to the knights of Camp Cloudtop and see what they have to say."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ107_01756_SEQ_02","Alas, none of the Rose Knights know what to make of the bone's markings─or, in the case of Fabrellet, are inclined to care. On the bright side, the quartermaster mentions that a shipment of provisions is scheduled to arrive soon. Perhaps this news will serve to lift Gildon's spirits."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ107_01756_SEQ_03","Upon hearing of the shipment, Gildon has an epiphany: the Vanu were using the bone to count the days between shipments, which always include a substantial quantity of crystals. Believing that the beastmen intend to launch an attack, he goes to warn Lady Laniaitte, and bids you warn Fabrellet in his stead."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ107_01756_SEQ_04","Fabrellet is unwilling to lend credence to Gildon's fears, and suggests that you make for the <Emphasis>Protector</Emphasis> if you are so concerned for the shipment's welfare."
5,"TEXT_HEAVNZ107_01756_SEQ_05","You board the <Emphasis>Protector</Emphasis> and find a Vanu preparing to flee with his prize. However, you make quick work of him and his allies. Examine the shipment to see that everything is accounted for."
6,"TEXT_HEAVNZ107_01756_SEQ_06","So far as you can tell, the Vanu were unable to steal any of the provisions. Return to Fabrellet and inform him that there was indeed a Vanu raid, and that you have foiled it."
7,"TEXT_HEAVNZ107_01756_SEQ_07","Fabrellet and Lady Laniaitte are pleased to learn that, thanks to you, the shipment is secure. At your insistence, the commander recognizes Gildon for his part in uncovering the Vanu's plans, offering him the opportunity to serve elsewhere, should it be his desire. Gildon declines, however, stating that his sole desire is to rekindle the spirits of his fellow knights. To that end, he proposes that he and the others partake of the provisions in celebration. Though Fabrellet scoffs at the idea, Lady Laniaitte agrees, and bids the quartermaster make it known whom the Rose Knights have to thank for their boon."
