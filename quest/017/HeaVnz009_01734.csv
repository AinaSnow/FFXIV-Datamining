49,"TEXT_HEAVNZ009_01734_SIGAN_000_001","The village here grew, years ago, around the barracks housing the Ishgardian scouting forces. It may have been a small village, but it had a long and rich history."
50,"TEXT_HEAVNZ009_01734_SIGAN_000_002","Being so close to the Dravanian border, it had its fair share of legend and wisdom passed down from generation to generation."

But the village─and all the belongings left behind in the Calamity's aftermath─still lies deep beneath the snow. I'd wager that feather ornament you found was previously dug up around here."

58,"TEXT_HEAVNZ009_01734_SIGAN_000_022","I've never been happier than when they first started talking about rebuilding Falcon's Nest. I thought I'd finally have the old village back."
59,"TEXT_HEAVNZ009_01734_SIGAN_000_023","Of course, the Holy See wasn't interested in the village at all. They just wanted their fortress. And now it's bigger and grander than ever before."
60,"TEXT_HEAVNZ009_01734_SIGAN_000_024","The Falcon's Nest I knew─that small village I grew up in─it's been lying under all this snow ever since the Calamity."
