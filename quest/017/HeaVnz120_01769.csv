1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ120_01769_SEQ_01","Saintrelmaux has been preparing the next step of Dominiac's plan, but he seems to be even more out of sorts than he normally is. He should be waiting near the base of the cliff to the north of the Convictory. Find him and find out what is wrong."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ120_01769_SEQ_02","Saintrelmaux assures you that there is nothing wrong with him. The trap, however, does not seem to be working. The more powerful members of the Dravanian Horde seem to be much more cunning and wise. Perhaps there is something about the corpse that gives it away as a trap. Examine it and make sure there is nothing amiss."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ120_01769_SEQ_03","The aevis corpse seems fine to you. Tell Saintrelmaux that you could not find anything wrong with it."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ120_01769_SEQ_04","With no visible problems with the trap, the only option is to wait patiently for a Dravanian to take the bait."
5,"TEXT_HEAVNZ120_01769_SEQ_05","You have slain the wyvern that was attracted by the dead aevis. Report back to Saintrelmaux."
6,"TEXT_HEAVNZ120_01769_SEQ_06","Inform Dominiac that the plan has succeeded. Saintrelmaux will handle getting the slain beast back to the Convictory."
7,"TEXT_HEAVNZ120_01769_SEQ_07","Dominiac thanks you for all your hard work. He asks you to check and make sure that Saintrelmaux has made it back to the camp safely."
8,"TEXT_HEAVNZ120_01769_SEQ_08","Saintrelmaux has finished hauling the downed dragons back to the Convictory and is about to start examining the wyvern's body for abnormalities. Lend a hand!"
9,"TEXT_HEAVNZ120_01769_SEQ_09","Upon checking the wyvern's claws, you discover scales from both a tulihand and a wadjet─no doubt from the creatures you previously slew. Return them to Saintrelmaux."
10,"TEXT_HEAVNZ120_01769_SEQ_10","Upon seeing the tulihand and wadjet scales, Saintrelmaux starts to realize the level of camaraderie among the Horde. Not to be outdone by the Dravanians, he pledges his life to the protection of those he knows and cares about─his friends and the people of Ishgard. Report to Dominiac that all is well."
11,"TEXT_HEAVNZ120_01769_SEQ_11","Dominiac is pleased with the progress of the plan and with Saintrelmaux's newfound purpose. The young soldier's example could serve as a beacon to other lost youths and rally them to Ser Aymeric's cause."

49,"TEXT_HEAVNZ120_01769_DOMINIAC_000_001","However, I'm concerned about Saintrelmaux. He seems even more morose than his normal grim self. I want to help him but─perhaps because I'm his commanding officer─he <Emphasis>really</Emphasis> doesn't want to talk to me about it."
50,"TEXT_HEAVNZ120_01769_DOMINIAC_000_002","Do you think you might be able to talk to him for me? The two of you have been through quite a few battles together now. He might be more inclined to share his troubles with you."
51,"TEXT_HEAVNZ120_01769_DOMINIAC_000_003","He's to the north of the camp. Preparations for the next step of the plan should all be finished by now, so he'll just be waiting for you there."

53,"TEXT_HEAVNZ120_01769_SAINTRELMAUX_000_010","Well met, friend. As you can see, the aevis's body has been laid out in plain sight, but none of the Horde have shown any interest in the thing."
54,"TEXT_HEAVNZ120_01769_SAINTRELMAUX_000_011","Me? Something I want to talk about? No, not really. Though, spending all day keeping vigil over Dravanian corpses leads one to thinking about these creatures more than one might expect."
55,"TEXT_HEAVNZ120_01769_SAINTRELMAUX_000_012","All things considered, this aevis was quite a high-ranking creature of the Horde. I've no doubt that whatever comes to collect its body will be quite a mighty dragon indeed. They're wise and intelligent creatures, and they won't be tricked easily."
56,"TEXT_HEAVNZ120_01769_SAINTRELMAUX_000_013","I've taken a great deal of care with the preparations. But still no dragon comes. Do you think you might take a look at the aevis for me? Just make sure there's nothing out of the ordinary─something I might have missed."

62,"TEXT_HEAVNZ120_01769_SAINTRELMAUX_000_051","An ancient creature that once soared effortlessly through the clouds. Most go their whole lives without ever seeing one of these legendary beasts... I should take a minute to check its body before we take it back to camp."

78,"TEXT_HEAVNZ120_01769_SAINTRELMAUX_000_095","In retrospect, I should have blamed myself. It's my own fault that I was abandoned by both those I served and those who served me."

91,"TEXT_HEAVNZ120_01769_DOMINIAC_000_205","If anything, I'd like nothing more than to recruit <Emphasis>you</Emphasis>. But somehow I get the feeling that you're not the kind to settle down in one place─much less somewhere as remote and isolated as the Convictory. Still, I hope that you'll continue to lend us your strength from time to time."
