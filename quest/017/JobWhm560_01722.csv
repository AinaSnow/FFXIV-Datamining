1,"TEXT_JOBWHM560_01722_SEQ_01","A troubled Eschiva informs you that the taint you earlier cleansed in the western highlands has reappeared. Consequently, the creatures nearby were driven into a frenzy once more, and they reportedly attacked a knight on patrol. Though the man managed to flee to the Convictory, he has suffered grievous wounds. And to compound matters, all of the camp's chirurgeons are afield and cannot readily return. Eschiva believes that you are his only chance for survival; do as she bids and make haste to the Convictory."
2,"TEXT_JOBWHM560_01722_SEQ_02","You arrive at the Convictory to find the wounded knight upon the ground, writhing in pain. Cast the Cure II spell on him and free him from his hurts."
3,"TEXT_JOBWHM560_01722_SEQ_03","Thanks to you, the knight will live. While Eschiva continues caring for him, make your way back to the taint that has reappeared west of Banepool, and purify it with extreme prejudice."
4,"TEXT_JOBWHM560_01722_SEQ_04","You succeed in purifying the taint a second time, shortly after which Eschiva arrives with information from the knight you saved. Before he was attacked, the man claims to have witnessed a woman fitting Alaqa's description heading west towards the Dravanian forelands. Convinced that Alaqa is somehow connected to the taint, Eschiva declares her intent to track her down. Make your own way to the Dravanian forelands and join her at the settlement of Tailfeather."
5,"TEXT_JOBWHM560_01722_SEQ_05","Eschiva informs you that a strange woman has been seen coming and going from Tailfeather. While Eschiva continues gathering information, dedicate yourself to honing your powers, that you might be prepared for the inevitable confrontation with Alaqa.

※The next white mage quest will be available from Eschiva upon reaching level 58."
