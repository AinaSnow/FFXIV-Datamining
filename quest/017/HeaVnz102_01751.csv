1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ102_01751_SEQ_01","You happen across a young man torn between personal desires and obligations. As a young boy, he promised he would wed when he came of age. This runs counter to his present goal of becoming a Temple Knight, which forbids marriage while undertaking training. He shamefully admits he cannot recall the girl's name, but remembers she was a ward of House Haillenarte. He asks that you find her and tell her she need not worry of fulfilling their promise. Speak with Bartelot outside Haillenarte Manor and see what you can discover."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ102_01751_SEQ_02","You speak with Bartelot at Haillenarte Manor. While there is no shortage of wards under the care of their house, he supposes Lady Laniaitte would be of an age with the woman you seek. Speak with Lady Laniaitte at the Rosehouse in the Sea of Clouds and see what she knows."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ102_01751_SEQ_03","You speak with Lady Laniaitte and learn she has heard of no such promises of marriage. However, she is certain that Marielle is of the right age for the girl you are after. Speak with Marielle about the promised marriage."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ102_01751_SEQ_04","Marielle confirms that she is in fact the woman you are looking for. To your surprise, however, she is indifferent to the message you bring to her. She too forgot the promise to marry many ages ago, and is committed to serving Lady Laniaitte at the Rosehouse."

I've told myself I would give anything to be a Temple Knight, but one of their rules gives me pause: we are forbidden from marrying while undergoing training."
49,"TEXT_HEAVNZ102_01751_SUFFERINGMAN01751_000_001","Hearing this brought to mind a promise I made long ago. Given to flights of fancy and romance─as children are wont to be─I promised a girl that we would marry when we came of age. I was just a boy, and to be honest I cannot even remember her name. But I worry she may still be waiting for me."
