1,"TEXT_JOBMCH581_01711_SEQ_01","Stephanivien informs you that Joye and several of her colleagues have caught up to Rostnsthal. Fearing that the determined instructor will be difficult to stop, the chief machinist sends you along to aid in his detainment. Head to the Pillars and confront Rostnsthal."
2,"TEXT_JOBMCH581_01711_SEQ_02","You arrive at the scene to find Rostnsthal in a tense confrontation with several machinists. Joye bids you fire upon the instructor, and take the fight out of him before anyone is seriously hurt. Approach Rostnsthal, and wind him with a Gauss Round."
3,"TEXT_JOBMCH581_01711_SEQ_03","You beat Rostnsthal on the draw, and impress upon him the efficacy of his own instruction. Stephanivien arrives soon after, and convinces the pirate that giving himself up will solve nothing in the long term. Rostnsthal then shares with you the sins of his past, and demands to be given the chance to atone by helping you defeat Veri Selen. Return to the Skysteel Manufactory and speak with Stephanivien."
4,"TEXT_JOBMCH581_01711_SEQ_04","Stephanivien has informed Tedalgrinche of the manufactory's decision to face Veri Selen. Even with Rostnsthal's promised aid, however, he fears that this challenge will test you and your fellow machinists to your very limits. Make the most of the time remaining before the battle to hone your skills to a razor's edge.

※The next machinist quest will be available from Stephanivien upon reaching level 60."
