Marcechamp has asked you to gather any information that would help in the wild bird's capture. Start by asking the leaders of his three camps what they know."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ305_01797_SEQ_02","After talking to the leaders of each camp, you find that the chocobo has been terrorizing hunters across the forest. Return to Tailfeather and report to Marcechamp."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ305_01797_SEQ_03","You have relayed the information on the wild chocobo to Marcechamp, and he explains to you that the prospect of dealing with a monster as smart as a chocobo is more terrifying than its actual size. Catching this bird will not prove to be an easy task."

Might be that this chocobo is takin' some kind of revenge on us hunters, an' these acts are a means of provokin' us. By all accounts, this chocobo is stronger an' more clever than the rest. I expect capturin' it won't be a simple feat."
