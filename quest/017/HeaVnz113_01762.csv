1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ113_01762_SEQ_01","Dominiac wants to support Ser Aymeric, but cannot do so without first gaining glory slaying dragons. Unfortunately, he is not having much luck. He simply does not know much about what he is hunting. Lend him a hand by finding out what you can about these mysterious creatures."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ113_01762_SEQ_02","The sly scout says he is happy to share his knowledge of dragons, but for a price. Do his patrol duty for him and he'll tell you what he knows."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ113_01762_SEQ_03","You have completed the patrol duty as requested. Return to the scout at the Convictory and find out what he knows."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ113_01762_SEQ_04","True to his word, the scout shares a useful secret about dragons. For reasons as yet unknown, the bodies of slain dragons seem to attract more powerful dragons. This has obvious tactical and strategic implications, but the scout implores you not to share this information, as it has the potential to be very, very dangerous. Tell Dominiac anyway."
5,"TEXT_HEAVNZ113_01762_SEQ_05","Dominiac realizes that he can start with a small dragon and, by leaving its corpse, attract larger prey. By repeating this process, he can attract increasingly larger dragons until he gains the glory he seeks. Hopefully he will use this knowledge wisely."

49,"TEXT_HEAVNZ113_01762_DOMINIAC_000_001","I want nothing more than to support the great Ser Aymeric. But Ishgardian society revolves around the nobility. Those not of noble birth─such as myself─have no power at all."
50,"TEXT_HEAVNZ113_01762_DOMINIAC_000_002","The only way to gain the power of nobility is through a truly noble display of courage. There's one simple way to do that─slay a monstrous, ancient dragon. There are some feats that cannot be ignored."
51,"TEXT_HEAVNZ113_01762_DOMINIAC_000_003","So I took up my spear and came to the Convictory. Sadly, things have not gone as well as I had hoped."

53,"TEXT_HEAVNZ113_01762_DOMINIAC_000_005","But you're not a Convictor. They're not competing with <Emphasis>you</Emphasis>. I doubt they'd be nearly as tight-lipped with you as they are with me and the other knights here. You might be able to learn a thing or two for me about how I might find and kill one of the larger dragons."
54,"TEXT_HEAVNZ113_01762_DOMINIAC_000_012","Try asking some of the knights here what they know about dragons. They're very tight-lipped around each other, but I suspect they might be a little more willing to talk with someone they're not directly competing with."

56,"TEXT_HEAVNZ113_01762_LANCER01762_000_011","Ohoho, don't think I'll be tellin' you for free, though. Tell you what: I'm due to go out on patrol any minute now, but it's far too bloody cold for it if you ask me. I'll put me patrol points in your map here, and if you go do my patrol for me, I'll tell you what I know."

62,"TEXT_HEAVNZ113_01762_LANCER01762_000_032","Now listen. Don't you go tellin' anyone about this, you hear? Just think what'd happen if everyone knew."
63,"TEXT_HEAVNZ113_01762_LANCER01762_000_033","Things're dangerous enough around here to begin with─especially lately.

66,"TEXT_HEAVNZ113_01762_SAINTRELMAUX_000_034","I've not seen you around the Convictory. Are you a new recruit? Not that it's any of my business, I suppose."

68,"TEXT_HEAVNZ113_01762_DOMINIAC_000_041","Hmmm. I see! So I can use the corpses of weaker dragons to attract bigger ones. It seems like I might be able to bag quite a prestigious catch this way..."
69,"TEXT_HEAVNZ113_01762_DOMINIAC_000_042","I start with a small one, kill that, then wait for a bigger one to come along. Then if I kill that one, an even <Emphasis>bigger</Emphasis> one should appear! Then I kill <Emphasis>that</Emphasis> one, and so on."
