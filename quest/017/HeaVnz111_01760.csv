1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ111_01760_SEQ_01","Jantellot wants you to know what life is like at the Convictory, and suggests a bit of hunting as an example. Though the Convictors slay dragons, Jantellot recommends a warm-up before confronting the Dravanian Horde itself. He suggests hunting rheums instead. Locate and slay three rheums."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ111_01760_SEQ_02","You venture out into the highlands and slay the rheums as instructed. Return to Jantellot at the Convictory and let him know that you are ready for something a bit more draconic."
