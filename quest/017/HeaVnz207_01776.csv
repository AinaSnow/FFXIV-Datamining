1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ207_01776_SEQ_01","Loupard has received information that a lone chocobo has been spotted wandering around to the south of Tailfeather. He suggests that such an easy mark would make the ideal first catch for the novice hunter Q'yantaa. Speak to her and see if she has any ideas regarding catching the bird."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ207_01776_SEQ_02","Q'yantaa's informed hunting strategy is to set up traps to the north of Tailfeather instead of the south, outwitting all of the other hunters. It becomes clear that while inexperienced, and sometimes over-enthusiastic, Q'yantaa does possess some measure of hunting instinct. Place her special concoction─some very fragrant gysahl greens─at the designated area to see if Q'yantaa's instincts bear any reward."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ207_01776_SEQ_03","You have placed the fragrant greens, glad to be rid of their pungent odor. Speak with Q'yantaa at the chocobo hunters' camp to the north."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ207_01776_SEQ_04","As if by fate, you hear the cry of a chocobo coming from where you set the trap just moments after you meet Q'yantaa in the northern camp. Hurry to see whether or not the chocobo fell for Q'yantaa's tricky concoction."
5,"TEXT_HEAVNZ207_01776_SEQ_05","You find a chocobo asleep peacefully near where the trap was set, and Q'yantaa exclaims her happiness in a barely legible manner. Return to Tailfeather and report the success of your unlikely duo to Loupard."
6,"TEXT_HEAVNZ207_01776_SEQ_06","Loupard can barely contain his disbelief when you tell him that Q'yantaa's scheme actually managed to catch something. Both he and you gain a newfound respect for the hunting instincts of the Miqo'te."

Seems a lone chocobo's been sighted wanderin' around not too far south, waitin' for a pair of hunters to come snatch it up. An easy target'll make the perfect first hunt for Q'yantaa."
50,"TEXT_HEAVNZ207_01776_LOUPARD_000_001","Now, don't go thinkin' this bird'll just walk right into your traps─Q'yantaa's still as green as they come. Go with her an' lend a hand afore she misses out on her first catch."

53,"TEXT_HEAVNZ207_01776_QYANTAA_000_011","Ah, wait─before I forget... Ah hah! This is the special mixture I made outta those mushrooms and some gysahl greens. Fragrant, aren't they?"
54,"TEXT_HEAVNZ207_01776_QYANTAA_000_012","The chocobo we're aiming to nab's been sighted to the south, which means plenty of hunters that <Emphasis>think</Emphasis> they're clever set up traps there. Lucky for us, though, I've thought one step ahead."
55,"TEXT_HEAVNZ207_01776_QYANTAA_000_013","You see, since so many hunters've been down south, their scent'll be as plain to the bird as this mushroom's is to us. Now if <Emphasis>I</Emphasis> was a chocobo, I'd steer well clear of that place."
56,"TEXT_HEAVNZ207_01776_QYANTAA_000_014","I might even be inclined to take a slightly more dangerous route so as to not run into any hunters. Now, if my instincts're right, that chocobo'll go right through bandersnatch territory. That's why we gotta set up <Emphasis>our</Emphasis> traps to the north. Brilliant idea, ain't it?"
57,"TEXT_HEAVNZ207_01776_QYANTAA_000_015","What's that? Don't tell me you're scared of the big bad bandersnatches! Just tread lightly and we'll both come back with a new chocobo. Here, let's divide up the greens and get to setting our traps. "
