1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ201_01770_SEQ_01","Virgeaume has asked you to check on the two traps he set up: one is upstream of the Whilom River and the other lies to the east of Tailfeather. Check if the chocobo traps have caught anything."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ201_01770_SEQ_02","It appears the chocobos that Virgeaume had intended to ensnare made off with the bait without triggering the traps. Bring him the sad news."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ201_01770_SEQ_03","Although Virgeaume mourns the loss of his bait, he is surprised that the birds─and you─were able to avoid his cleverly dug pitfalls."

49,"TEXT_HEAVNZ201_01770_VIRGEAUME_000_001","There are two of them: one upstream of the Whilom River and one out to the east of Tailfeather. All you really need to do is head out there to see if they've caught anything."
