0,"TEXT_HEAVNZ212_01781_SEQ_00","Loupard has one more hunter that might meet Q'yantaa's standards."
1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ212_01781_SEQ_01","Eager not to repeat the failure of last time, Loupard has found another hunter whose reputation in the camp is growing fast. However, something about the hunter's attitude fills Loupard with trepidation, and he has asked you to look after Q'yantaa once more. Speak with Bauricoin and make sure Q'yantaa will be safe with her new partner."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ212_01781_SEQ_02","While Bauricoin's rude and arrogant temperament rubs both you and Q'yantaa the wrong way, Q'yantaa is determined to show him that she is much more than the naive novice that he thinks she is. Speak with Q'yantaa at the northwestern camp to see where this hunt will lead."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ212_01781_SEQ_03","You arrive at the encampment at the agreed-upon time, but Bauricoin is nowhere to be found. Q'yantaa will keep a diligent eye out from her post─search the surrounding area for any signs of the haughty hunter."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ212_01781_SEQ_04","You find Bauricoin hunched over a lifeless chocobo with an arrow through its neck, and nearby you see a tragic sight: unhatched chocobo eggs. Bauricoin claims credit for this grisly deed, and seems unfazed by this brazen affront to the rules of Tailfeather, declaring that he will bring his catch back to the camp on his own. Hurry and inform Q'yantaa of this tragic turn of events."
5,"TEXT_HEAVNZ212_01781_SEQ_05","Q'yantaa can barely contain her rage as you recount the story of Bauricoin to her, showing a surprising amount of compassion for the wild chocobos. She will hurry back to Tailfeather to inform Loupard of Bauricoin's infraction of the camp's long-standing rules. Follow her back to the camp to watch the drama unfold."
6,"TEXT_HEAVNZ212_01781_SEQ_06","Loupard is disgusted at Bauricoin's selfish and deplorable actions, summarily exiling him from Tailfeather. Although the search for Q'yantaa's partner must begin anew, the forests of the Dravanian forelands are a bit safer thanks to the strict rules of its chocobo hunters."

49,"TEXT_HEAVNZ212_01781_LOUPARD_000_000","Ah, you're both here right in time. I've made the acquaintance of another hunter that's lookin' for a partner, and took the liberty of puttin' Q'yantaa's name forward."
50,"TEXT_HEAVNZ212_01781_LOUPARD_000_001","His name's Bauricoin, and though he's only been here but a short while, he's built quite a reputation for himself. He should be over near the storehouse. Why don't you go ahead an' make your acquaintances?"
51,"TEXT_HEAVNZ212_01781_QYANTAA_000_002","Finally, someone worth hunting with! Let's not waste any time!"
52,"TEXT_HEAVNZ212_01781_LOUPARD_000_003","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, I couldn't say this to Q'yantaa, but somethin' about this hunter has me feelin' uneasy. Look after the two of 'em an' make sure nothin' goes amiss."

55,"TEXT_HEAVNZ212_01781_BAURICOIN_000_010","Hmmm? What do you want?"
56,"TEXT_HEAVNZ212_01781_BAURICOIN_000_011","...A partner? Ah... I remember that fool Loupard going on about something like that. So, you're the greenhorn he sent along?"

58,"TEXT_HEAVNZ212_01781_BAURICOIN_000_013","Hmph. Loupard has some nerve, sending me an untrained child. Can you even nock that bow? Very well, prove yourself in the hunt and maybe I'll let you carry the chocobo back."

61,"TEXT_HEAVNZ212_01781_QYANTAA_000_020","He sure talked big, but I don't see him anywhere. Hmph, some hunter! If you spy any traces of him, let me know."

63,"TEXT_HEAVNZ212_01781_BAURICOIN_000_030","...Oh, it's you. So you do her searching for her too? ...What's that? As you can see, I had good reason to delay my arrival. A hunter would keep his own mother waiting if he caught prey in his sights."
64,"TEXT_HEAVNZ212_01781_BAURICOIN_000_031","I felled this chocobo with a single arrow. And what's more, there's a bountiful nest of eggs as well!"

78,"TEXT_HEAVNZ212_01781_BAURICOIN_000_055","You... What kind of piss-poor hunters are you!? A golden chocobo'd be sitting on your lap and all you'd do is coddle it! I don't need the likes of you anyways!"
79,"TEXT_HEAVNZ212_01781_LOUPARD_000_056","Apologies, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, I should've known his sort the moment he came struttin' into camp. Well, looks like we're back on the hunt for a partner. The third arrow always strikes true, as they say!"
