She is able to identify it as being from the Sixth Astral Era, but can tell no more than that. She asks you to take it to Sigan, a local man who collects relics from that period."

59,"TEXT_HEAVNZ008_01733_AURIAUNE_000_034","There's a humorless old man named Sigan who collects antiques from the small mountain village that used to be here at Falcon's Nest. I'm sure he'd love to take a look at something like this. Do you think you could do me a favor and take it to him?"
