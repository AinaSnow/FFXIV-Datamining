She storms off, and the two Seedseers are left to ponder her words. Though the law binds them to the forest, they concede that it will all count for naught if the people lose faith in them. For the time being, sit tight while A–Ruhn examines the piece of tainted flesh for clues.

※The next white mage quest will be available from Raya–O–Senna upon reaching level 60."
