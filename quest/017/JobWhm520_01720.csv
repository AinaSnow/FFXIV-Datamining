0,"TEXT_JOBWHM520_01720_SEQ_00","Eschiva has uncovered a clue for your quest to purge the taint."
1,"TEXT_JOBWHM520_01720_SEQ_01","The taint was once borne to the Twelveswood via subterranean water veins, and Eschiva has reason to believe that it comes again in like manner. She bids you meet her at Camp Dragonhead in the central highlands of Coerthas, that you might investigate water veins in the area."
2,"TEXT_JOBWHM520_01720_SEQ_02","Eschiva has learned that a water vein passes beneath an area to the south. The fiends that lurk there have grown unnaturally aggressive of late, and Eschiva attributes this change to the taint's influence. A regiment of knights is currently on a mission to cull the frenzied creatures, and Eschiva suggests that you join them. Meet her at the specified spot south of Camp Dragonhead."
3,"TEXT_JOBWHM520_01720_SEQ_03","With your aid, the knights succeed in eliminating the frenzied creatures. The area thus secured, you may now purify the manifestation of the taint."
4,"TEXT_JOBWHM520_01720_SEQ_04","Immediately after you purify the taint, your soul crystal takes on a new radiance─a bestowal of power from A–Towa–Cant, if Eschiva is to be believed. Your companion goes on to posit that the act of purifying serves to empower the white mage. Return to Camp Dragonhead to discuss the next step of your mission with Eschiva."
5,"TEXT_JOBWHM520_01720_SEQ_05","Eschiva informs you that the headwater of the vein you just visited is situated further west, and through the city of Ishgard. While she conducts research on your next destination, take the time to accustom yourself with your newfound power, that you might be prepared for the challenges ahead.

※The next white mage quest will be available from Eschiva upon reaching level 54."

49,"TEXT_JOBWHM520_01720_ESCHIVA_000_001","There is a passage which tells of the time when the taint reached the forest via a subterranean water vein. Master A–Towa traced it back to its source at Abalathia's Spine, and there he purged the corruption."

52,"TEXT_JOBWHM520_01720_ESCHIVA_000_004","If we then consider the great one's warning that the taint shall “flood” the forest, I am inclined to conclude that befouled aether is being conveyed via water veins."
53,"TEXT_JOBWHM520_01720_ESCHIVA_000_005","Years have passed since Master A–Towa purged the taint. A new source of corruption may well have manifested in the intervening time."

57,"TEXT_JOBWHM520_01720_ESCHIVA_000_012","While I awaited your arrival, I spoke with some of the knights about water veins. They say that one passes beneath the area just south of here."

59,"TEXT_JOBWHM520_01720_ESCHIVA_000_014","I would wager that the taint is to blame for this change."
60,"TEXT_JOBWHM520_01720_ESCHIVA_000_015","A short while ago, a band of knights departed for the area in question on a mission to cull the unruly creatures. Shall we go and join them?"
