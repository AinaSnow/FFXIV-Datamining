1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ208_01777_SEQ_01","Thanks to Q'yantaa's rising reputation in Tailfeather, Loupard finally has an eager volunteer for the position of her partner. Venture to the southeast of Tailfeather to inform Q'yantaa of the good news."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ208_01777_SEQ_02","You find Q'yantaa staring diligently at a rock wall for reasons unknown and unexplained to you. After you inform her of Loupard's good news, she hurries off to Tailfeather before telling you exactly what it was she was doing. Return to Tailfeather and speak with Loupard to finally meet your potential replacement."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ208_01777_SEQ_03","The partner that Loupard has found looks uncomfortable in the chocobo hunter's garb, and the disappointment is clear in Q'yantaa's expression. Since he seems hesitant to introduce himself, speak with him to lighten the mood."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ208_01777_SEQ_04","It seems Q'yantaa has been busy using her hunter's instincts to find the best places for chocobo hunting, but she seems skeptical of her new partner's abilities. Once again, she asks you to help her hunt. Split up and investigate the trap locations for any signs of chocobos."
5,"TEXT_HEAVNZ208_01777_SEQ_05","Try as you might, you fail to find any trace of chocobos in or around the traps. Return to Tailfeather and inform Q'yantaa of the bad news. "
6,"TEXT_HEAVNZ208_01777_SEQ_06","Q'yantaa seems surprisingly accepting of the fact that her instincts failed her, and instead she expresses her frustration at Gysol's tardiness. In a sudden show of compassion, her frustration turns to worry that her new partner might actually be in danger, and she resolves to go looking for him with you in tow. Accompany her to find the nervous hunter before some other beast does."
7,"TEXT_HEAVNZ208_01777_SEQ_07","You find Gysol in a surprising situation: cooing over a chocobo hatchling which has apparently been separated from its parents. Despite Q'yantaa's protestations, Gysol resolves to take care of the chick himself, and to give up on chocobo hunting in favor of working in the stables. Return to Tailfeather and inform Loupard of this confusing hunting trip."
8,"TEXT_HEAVNZ208_01777_SEQ_08","Loupard explains that hunters are not allowed to capture chocobo eggs or chicks, but decides to make an exception for Gysol considering that the chick would be helpless without him. With one more person in Eorzea realizing their dreams thanks to the Warrior of Light, you begin your search for Q'yantaa's partner anew."

Some say it's beginner's luck, but a few've expressed interest in joinin' with her to see a Miqo'te hunt for themselves. I've taken the liberty of findin' one I think might make a good match."
49,"TEXT_HEAVNZ208_01777_LOUPARD_000_001","He's a fresh-arrived hunter that goes by the name of Gysol. I'm thinkin' we should have a li'l trial hunt to see if he and our budding prodigy get along."

51,"TEXT_HEAVNZ208_01777_LOUPARD_000_003","With any luck, she'll be off havin' adventures on her own in no time at all.

85,"TEXT_HEAVNZ208_01777_LOUPARD_000_081","Now about the hatchlin' he brought along... Generally, we don't allow hunters to take eggs or chicks, since if we did, pretty soon the forest'd be nothin' but bandersnatches and dragons."
86,"TEXT_HEAVNZ208_01777_LOUPARD_000_082","But it looks like this one's lost its mother, and Gysol seems right adamant about raisin' it himself, so...I think I can make an exception this time."
