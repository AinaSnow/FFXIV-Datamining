1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ011_01736_SEQ_01","Ingaret had hoped for an opportunity to search the frozen docks near Camp Riversmeet for her grandfather's lost things, but cannot leave her post unmanned. With feral beasts prowling the docks, she cannot send just anyone to search the area in her place─she decides that you are just the <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If> for the job. Prove her judgment sound by negotiating the wildlife and returning with her grandfather's trappings."

3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ011_01736_SEQ_03","Ingaret thanks you for recovering her grandfather's trappings─reminders of his time as a ferryman at Riversmeet. As mementos of the duty and responsibilities he left behind when fleeing the highlands, she hopes they will help him rediscover the purpose he has lost in his life in recent years."
