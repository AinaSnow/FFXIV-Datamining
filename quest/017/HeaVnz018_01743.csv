1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ018_01743_SEQ_01","Lord Emmanellain has tasked Torsefers with delivering a letter to Lady Laniaitte at the Rosehouse in the Sea of Clouds. Fearing that something may go wrong─and thereby incurring the wrath of Lord Emmanellain─Torsefers asks you to deliver it in his stead."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ018_01743_SEQ_02","You deliver the letter to Lady Laniaitte, and the overpowering fragrance of roses tells her immediately who sent it. As she tells it, she and Lord Emmanellain have known one another since childhood. Though he is a man grown, his behavior can still be childish at times."

<sigh> Okay... I suppose there is no harm in telling you."

I remember him specifically mentioning that failure would <Emphasis>not</Emphasis> be tolerated. It is a simple task, yet the thought of something going awry has my stomach in knots."

55,"TEXT_HEAVNZ018_01743_LANIAITTE_000_022","I'm afraid to say he's always been like this. House Haillenarte and House Fortemps have always maintained good relations, and as such, those close in years often spend time together from an early age."
56,"TEXT_HEAVNZ018_01743_LANIAITTE_000_023","I spent much of my youth playing together with Lord Emmanellain, but now... I fear he still clings too tightly to memories of our youth. Though I admit it is sometimes to my benefit."
57,"TEXT_HEAVNZ018_01743_LANIAITTE_000_024","Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for Torsefers. No doubt he asked you to come in his place. I can sympathize with his anxiety over upsetting Lord Emmanellain, but this is no way to treat a guest. Please accept this as a token of my apology. I realize it's not much, but it is all I can offer at present."
