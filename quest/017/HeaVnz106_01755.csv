1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ106_01755_SEQ_01","Laniaitte informs you that weapons and armor have been stolen from their storehouse. Although she dispatched men to retrieve them, she has yet to receive word of their progress and fears the Vanu are to blame. Knowing that they planned to begin searching around Vundu Ok' Bendu, Laniaitte asks that you head there and look for signs of the Rose Knights. "
