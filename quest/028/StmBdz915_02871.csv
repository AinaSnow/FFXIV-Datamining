60,"TEXT_STMBDZ915_02871_ATHALA_000_017","In all my time as a conjurer I have never struck a blow against an enemy. There was always some ploy at my disposal, a clever use of the terrain to outmaneuver my enemies. But the barren lands of Gyr Abania would afford me no such luxury."

What filled the air next was not my cries of agony, but the sweet song of steel against steel. I then opened my eyes to an amazing sight. At first I thought it a bean sprout jumping furiously to and fro, but lo and behold, it was Kakalai!"

I honestly had no idea where I was going. I only knew that death was at my back. Before I knew it, I was careening into a soldier, and I instinctively readied my blade."
78,"TEXT_STMBDZ915_02871_KAKALAI_000_037","I defeated him with relative ease, but sadly he was not alone. More soldiers beyond counting stood before me, and a mechanical monster still giving chase behind. In that moment I grew tired of it all. Tired of running, tired of living. So I rushed headlong into the throng of soldiers."
79,"TEXT_STMBDZ915_02871_KAKALAI_000_038","I swung my sword wildly, caring not for the blows they made against me. Where there should have been pain, there was only a soothing breeze blowing against my back. I felt reinvigorated, and so I kept fighting down to the last man. It was only then that I looked back."
80,"TEXT_STMBDZ915_02871_KAKALAI_000_039","What I saw there behind me I can describe only as perfection. The gods must have grown jealous of her beauty and cast her down from the heavens."
81,"TEXT_STMBDZ915_02871_KAKALAI_000_040","But my sweet angel was not yet free from danger. The magitek drone was still following me. So I ran before it was close enough to open fire on the both of us. "
82,"TEXT_STMBDZ915_02871_KAKALAI_000_041","I ran and ran until I found a support unit of the Allied forces. I was safe...and in love."
83,"TEXT_STMBDZ915_02871_KAKALAI_000_042","It is unfair to say that I saved her. No, she is the one who saved me. When next we receive our wages I will have to get her something."
