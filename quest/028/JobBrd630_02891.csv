1,"TEXT_JOBBRD630_02891_SEQ_01","Against Sanson's express instructions to lay low in the garrison, Nourval has been doing anything but, approaching and questioning every single soldier about. While Sanson keeps an eye on the froward civilian, he bids you find Guydelot and ask what your fellow bard has been able to glean from the locals."
2,"TEXT_JOBBRD630_02891_SEQ_02","Instead of sharing his findings, Guydelot saddles you with a task. Masked bandits have been terrorizing the area of late, and your fellow bard would have you investigate a Twin Adder scout who is late to report back. While Guydelot keeps an eye on a suspicious Nourval, he bids you make your way to the northeast of the Fringes towards Schism, where the soldier was headed."
3,"TEXT_JOBBRD630_02891_SEQ_03","Near Pike Falls, you find the Twin Adder scout at the mercy of the masked bandits, and promptly drive away the assailants. With the area secured, render assistance to the ailing scout."
4,"TEXT_JOBBRD630_02891_SEQ_04","The Twin Adder scout thanks you for your timely intervention, and observes that the bandits seemed to know of his coming in advance and sought to bar his path. Take word of the encounter back to your comrades at Castrum Oriens."
5,"TEXT_JOBBRD630_02891_SEQ_05","At Sanson's insistence, Nourval reveals that the tome rests in a place connected to Gylbarde, the renowned general who led the Ala Mhigan forces during the Autumn War. Putting two and two together, Guydelot suggests that the bandits may also be after the tome. The possibility seems to rattle Nourval, who excuses himself in spite of Sanson's protests. At this time, Guydelot reveals that Nourval has been stealing out of the castrum while your backs are turned. Sanson decides to allow Nourval to act freely in order to learn his true purpose, and bids you stand at the ready for whatever may come to pass.

※The next bard quest will be available from Sanson upon reaching level 65."
