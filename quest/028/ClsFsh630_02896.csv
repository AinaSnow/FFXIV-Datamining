1,"TEXT_CLSFSH630_02896_SEQ_01","As the visibly galled guildmaster tells it, Govv had an epiphany of sorts and took off on his own towards Gyr Abania, heading towards the Velodyna River which flows through the valley. Wawalago can only assume the river has some connection with the shooting stars' disappearance from La Noscean waters, but he is worried for the beastman's safety in distant lands where his kind rarely venture. He implores you to give chase after Govv to ensure that the spirited Sahagin does not get into trouble. Before that, however, the two of you decide to make for Pike Falls to meet one of your angler acquaintances from Coerthas, whose help Wawalago has beseeched in the business of tracking down the disappearing fish."
2,"TEXT_CLSFSH630_02896_SEQ_02","The capable cooperator enlisted by Wawalago happens to be none other than Reyna, fisher by day and assassin by night. While her investigation has turned up valid insights into the disappearance of the shooting stars, Govv dismisses her findings as a fabrication, on the basis that shorewalkers like you and Reyna possess only a superficial understanding of matters of the sea. Seeking to give Govv a taste of humility, Reyna proposes a contest to demonstrate the full depths of your angling expertise. Reel in three deep Velodyna carp before Govv does to prove that you are as capable a fisher as he."
3,"TEXT_CLSFSH630_02896_SEQ_03","You easily win your fishing contest against Govv, who─as an ocean-dweller─is not acclimated to freshwater fishing. With the humbled Sahagin now offering a more receptive ear, Reyna elaborates on her findings, that the Sahagins' so-called shooting stars are likely the same schools of migratory fish that can be found further east, although the actual location of their spawning beds remains unknown. As she seeks further information from fishers in the region, she asks you to relay the news in full to Guildmaster Wawalago."
4,"TEXT_CLSFSH630_02896_SEQ_04","You relay the details of Reyna's investigations to Wawalago, along with the story of your little contest with Govv, which amuses the old guildmaster greatly. After spending a moment to fawn over Reyna's formidable faculty for fishing─along with her many other alluring assets─Wawalago bids you bide your time until she contacts the guild with any further information.

※The next fisher quest will be available from Wawalago upon reaching level 65."

53,"TEXT_CLSFSH630_02896_WAWALAGO_000_030","Young Govv's got guts, I'll give him that, and it may take more than one angler to reel him in if he gets rowdy. I've contacted our cohorts in Coerthas, and they've consented to send an apt acquaintance to accompany you."

58,"TEXT_CLSFSH630_02896_REYNA_000_051","Ah, yes─the Sahagin fellow. We just made each other's acquaintance. I saw a large shadow swimming beneath the surface of the Velodyna and when I cast my line, I found him on the other end of it.

69,"TEXT_CLSFSH630_02896_REYNA_000_070","Fine work, as always! You never cease to amaze with how quickly you assess the swimming patterns of your prey, even in unfamiliar waters. Let's call Govv back and settle this once and for all."
70,"TEXT_CLSFSH630_02896_REYNA_000_080","Well, would you look at this. <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> cast, hooked, and reeled in three carp before you even set your sights on a single one. How does it feel to lose to a land-dweller, Govv?"
71,"TEXT_CLSFSH630_02896_GOVV_000_081","Pshhh... I did not expect fishing in fresh waters to be ssso arduousss. For a shhhorewalker like you to outfish a Sahagin─there are no wordsss to expresss my shame..."
72,"TEXT_CLSFSH630_02896_REYNA_000_082","Maybe now you've realized there's some worth to what we have to say. Now, shall we return to the topic of the shooting stars?"
73,"TEXT_CLSFSH630_02896_GOVV_000_083","Pshhh. Capable fishermen you may be, but I have already found my anssswer. The shooting ssstars have disappeared because this river has been sssullied by the ceruleum ssspilling out into its waters."
74,"TEXT_CLSFSH630_02896_REYNA_000_084","And if you would let me finish a sentence for just once, I would tell you this isn't so. Why, your prized fish aren't even native to this river! I've discovered beyond a shadow of a doubt that they hail from further to the east!"
75,"TEXT_CLSFSH630_02896_REYNA_000_085","You see, I came to these parts for business. As <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> knows, my true profession is to ensure that my clients' enemies, ah, sleep with the fish.

76,"TEXT_CLSFSH630_02896_REYNA_000_086","So I asked around based upon information relayed to me by Wawalago, pressing anglers from Eastern lands on the whereabouts of fish resembling the shooting stars' description."

79,"TEXT_CLSFSH630_02896_REYNA_000_089","Let me finish for once, would you? Furthermore, in East Othard, I found fish of the selfsame appearance as those in Thavnair. Red as blood, but this time a mere <Emphasis>twenty</Emphasis> ilms in length."
80,"TEXT_CLSFSH630_02896_GOVV_000_090","P...pshhh!? It all makesss sssense now! The shooting ssstars my clutch saw were fully grown! They begin life in the Far East as ssslight hatchlings, gradually growing to gargantuan sssize as they journey to the wessst!"
81,"TEXT_CLSFSH630_02896_REYNA_000_091","That's what I've been trying to tell you from the start! If the numbers that embark on that rite of passage have dwindled to all but nothing, it stands to reason that whatever happened, happened in the vicinity of their spawning beds."
82,"TEXT_CLSFSH630_02896_REYNA_000_092","That said, we still have a lot of ground─and water─to cover before we can fully ascertain just where their nursery is located.

84,"TEXT_CLSFSH630_02896_REYNA_000_094","And you there! I do hope you've learned your lesson about underestimating the talents of shorewalkers. Try to avoid jumping to conclusions next time we meet, won't you?"
