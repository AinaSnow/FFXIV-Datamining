50,"TEXT_STMBDZ827_02855_OGGERY_000_002","There is a way to save them, though. I need you to head to the watering hole to the southwest, and find a couple of mosslings to hack apart."
51,"TEXT_STMBDZ827_02855_OGGERY_000_003","Gather up what's left of them, and then bury the clumps in between the roots of the trees that grow near the water. That should do the trick."
52,"TEXT_STMBDZ827_02855_OGGERY_000_004","You'll find the mosslings in the watering hole to the southwest. They're surprisingly aggressive little buggers, so you shouldn't have any trouble getting their attention."
53,"TEXT_STMBDZ827_02855_OGGERY_000_005","Once you've reduced a couple to mossy clumps, bury what's left of them in the roots of the nearby trees. That's all there is to it."
54,"TEXT_STMBDZ827_02855_OGGERY_000_010","Got some mossling clumps, have you? Look for the trees with rotted roots over by the watering hole, and mulch those mossy remains into the dirt at the base of their trunks."

56,"TEXT_STMBDZ827_02855_OGGERY_000_021","There's a certain mold which afflicts the tree roots, see, and some property of the mosslings works to kill that mold off. I don't rightly know how or why it works, but the trees are hardy enough to recover from the damage."
