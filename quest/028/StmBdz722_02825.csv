1,"TEXT_STMBDZ722_02825_SEQ_01","Inspired by your display of skill against the gazelle, M'zhet Tia rushes off to go and defeat M'rahz Nunh. Not wanting to miss the battle, you follow him back to the Peering Stones."
2,"TEXT_STMBDZ722_02825_SEQ_02","You arrive to find M'zhet Tia on the ground, writhing in pain. As he finds the strength to stand and take his leave, M'rahz Nunh stops him to ask why he is so insistent on becoming nunh. M'zhet Tia accuses him of stealing the title from his father, after which they were forced to leave the tribe when he was a child. He goes on to say his father abandoned him, and believes it would not have happened if not for M'rahz Nunh. The M tribe leader is shocked to hear all of this, as he had not seen M'zhet Tia or his father since they left the tribe all those years ago. He claims M'zhet Tia's father relinquished the title willingly, but is bewildered as to why he would abandon his son. He asks to take M'zhet Tia with you and investigate M'aht Nunh's disappearance."

58,"TEXT_STMBDZ722_02825_MRAHZNUN_000_018","There was a time when the M tribe was led by two nunhs. In the common tongue it is often interpreted as chief of the tribe, but first and foremost we are a father to our people."
59,"TEXT_STMBDZ722_02825_MRAHZNUN_000_019","When our hunting grounds are vast and children many, it is sometimes necessary to have a second nunh as we once did. After the Garleans invaded, however, our lands diminished as did our numbers."
