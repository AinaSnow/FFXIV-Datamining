52,"TEXT_STMBDZ709_02812_TRADER02812_000_004","I have passed my days here in longing to meet her. I have waited outside the theater. I have sought to gain insight into where she might be and when. I have done all I can, yet still the gods have not seen fit to send her to me."

It may not be my place to tell you this, but all we show on the stage at the Mujikoza is just that─show. It is fancy and fabrication, meant to appear as a dream. None of us truly look as we do in character. "

61,"TEXT_STMBDZ709_02812_TRADER02812_000_021","A sweetly scented perfume? Yes... Yes, I smelled such a fragrance from my seat in the audience! Those who left split into two groups. Let us split as well, and let the hunt for my infatuation continue!"

68,"TEXT_STMBDZ709_02812_WABISABIACTOR02812_000_033","Hmmm... No, I know of no actress matching the description you've made. It sounds more as if your friend is speaking of some ravishing beauty he saw in a fever dream."

73,"TEXT_STMBDZ709_02812_WABISABIACTOR02812_000_050","Ugh, I'd not thought this would all lead to <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> coming along. <sigh> Very well, I suppose I could give you the truth, then."
74,"TEXT_STMBDZ709_02812_TRADER02812_000_051","Please, I must meet her. I simply must! This fragrance on you, it is hers. I know it to be! Tell me, what do you know of her. Tell me anything. Everything!"
75,"TEXT_STMBDZ709_02812_WABISABIACTOR02812_000_052","I can see you have no intention of leaving me be until I've answered. And so I will. But you may not find the truth so beautiful as your infatuation. For I am she."
76,"TEXT_STMBDZ709_02812_TRADER02812_000_053","No... No, that simply cannot be. That is impossible. And yet... That voice. That neck. Those contours."
77,"TEXT_STMBDZ709_02812_WABISABIACTOR02812_000_054","As a man grown you should know─every man knows far more of the female form than any woman. That is how I am able to portray the woman of every man's dreams. And so you know the truth. What, then, of your fantasies now? Shattered, are they?"
78,"TEXT_STMBDZ709_02812_TRADER02812_000_055","No... No, they are far from shattered. I feel stronger towards you now than ever! I regret that I must soon depart Kugane, but my business will bring me here again soon. And when it does, I will come and see you at every show!"
79,"TEXT_STMBDZ709_02812_WABISABIACTOR02812_000_056","Then on such evenings I will be sure I am at my most beautiful for you."
80,"TEXT_STMBDZ709_02812_TRADER02812_000_057","This city is truly a marvel, is it not? The culture here is far more rich and complex than any other I've seen or known. I will be back, again and again, and again and again! Thank you, adventurer. You have given me a great gift this day."
