49,"TEXT_STMBDZ916_02872_SWETHRYKBROOKSTONE_000_001","I received a rather urgent call for assistance from one of our scouts and all of my men are preoccupied with duties elsewhere. "
50,"TEXT_STMBDZ916_02872_SWETHRYKBROOKSTONE_000_002","I'd like you to go and speak with Flame Sergeant Dodogun. You'll find him at his post near Gyr Kehim."
51,"TEXT_STMBDZ916_02872_SWETHRYKBROOKSTONE_000_003","Flame Sergeant Dodogun wouldn't call unless it was of the utmost importance. I suggest you hurry to him."
52,"TEXT_STMBDZ916_02872_DODOGUN_000_010","So they've sent the morbol slayer, have they? I suppose you'll do."
53,"TEXT_STMBDZ916_02872_DODOGUN_000_011","A few bells ago, I spotted what looked like a Resistance fighter in a skirmish with the Ananta. As a general rule the Alliance doesn't intervene in local disputes, but I suspect something is amiss. "
54,"TEXT_STMBDZ916_02872_DODOGUN_000_012","The altercation took place along a path between the Qalyana and Vira settlements, and neither the Alliance nor the Resistance has any business being there. I wouldn't have been overly concerned if not for the fact that the man I sent down there to investigate hasn't returned."
55,"TEXT_STMBDZ916_02872_DODOGUN_000_013","I'd like you to go to Sathya Maga and see if he's gotten himself into any trouble. If you find anything, you can contact me via the linkpearl we gave you."
56,"TEXT_STMBDZ916_02872_DODOGUN_000_014","The recruit I sent down there should have been back by now. If you find anything at Sathya Maga, don't hesitate to contact me."

She wouldn't even speak─only ceaseless hissing with seemingly murderous intent. If not for you I would likely be dead like that gentleman just over there."
59,"TEXT_STMBDZ916_02872_RECRUIT02872_000_021","From what I could gather before we were assaulted, he was seizing crystals from their encampment. I assumed it was to stop the summoning of a primal."
60,"TEXT_STMBDZ916_02872_DODOGUN_000_022","(-Flame Sergeant Dodogun-)Ahem. Forgive the intrusion, but judging by his uniform, I'm not so sure he was a member of the Resistance to begin with. Well, I wouldn't call it a uniform so much as an unconvincing costume. He likely stole bits and pieces off of fallen soldiers. "
61,"TEXT_STMBDZ916_02872_DODOGUN_000_023","(-Flame Sergeant Dodogun-)I also very much doubt he was here for crystals. You can clearly see the jewelry hanging out of his satchel. Nothing but a petty thief if you ask me."

68,"TEXT_STMBDZ916_02872_SWETHRYKBROOKSTONE_000_033","While the forces stationed at Rhalgr's Reach are the most involved in our fight against the Garleans, there are other smaller factions─some even formed haphazardly─who claim to be Resistance fighters if only for the chance to loot and plunder."
69,"TEXT_STMBDZ916_02872_SWETHRYKBROOKSTONE_000_034","It is imperative this man is identified to determine who can be held accountable. <sigh> If we had more recruits like you we likely wouldn't have to worry about such things."
