...Hm? I take it you are surprised that the informant was a Namazu."
56,"TEXT_STMBDZ701_02804_LADYSOLDIER02804_000_021","You see, arrogant as they are, the Garleans think the Namazu beneath their attention. He and his kind can get close to them without raising suspicion."

63,"TEXT_STMBDZ701_02804_LADYSOLDIER02804_000_041","And today, he tells us that a band of imperial defectors has taken to banditry in the region. Command will wish to hear of this."
64,"TEXT_STMBDZ701_02804_LADYSOLDIER02804_000_042","I will hasten ahead to the House of the Fierce. My apologies, but may I trouble you to transport this crate in my stead?"

68,"TEXT_STMBDZ701_02804_LADYSOLDIER02804_000_053","But the reality is there can be no peace under the Garleans, and full many are doing their part to bring about Doman liberation. Like the souls whom you met today. Like yourself."
