1,"TEXT_JOBBRD650_02892_SEQ_01","Following extended surveillance, Sanson and Guydelot are confident that Nourval is in league with the masked bandits. In order to catch the man red-handed, Sanson has contrived to lure him out of the castrum with his guard lowered. Find Nourval inside the stronghold and lead him into thinking that the way is clear."
2,"TEXT_JOBBRD650_02892_SEQ_02","You inform Nourval that your two comrades are tied up, and the man takes the bait and hastens away. Join Sanson outside the castrum."
3,"TEXT_JOBBRD650_02892_SEQ_03","Sanson is pleased that his ploy has worked, and even now Guydelot shadows Nourval to his destination. Make your way to the ruin called Gyr Kehim to the northeast and join your fellow bard on the chase."
4,"TEXT_JOBBRD650_02892_SEQ_04","You catch Nourval meeting with the masked bandits, who have found the tome you seek─the journal of the Ala Mhigan general Gylbarde. Eavesdropping on their conversation, you learn their true purpose: stoking the fires of anti-Ala Mhigan sentiment. Determined not to let this come to pass, your party confronts Nourval's, and at the end of a fierce confrontation, you emerge the victor and with the journal in your hands."
5,"TEXT_JOBBRD650_02892_SEQ_05","The defeated Nourval flees the scene, but not before revealing that he is descended from Vainchelon. And in turn, the journal reveals that Vainchelon did not die of illness as is believed, but rather was poisoned by Gylbarde at a secret meeting. The revelation comes as a shock to Sanson and Guydelot, who worry what may happen should the truth be made public knowledge. There is clearly much to mull over; for now, return to Castrum Oriens with your comrades."
6,"TEXT_JOBBRD650_02892_SEQ_06","Back at Castrum Oriens, Sanson shares with you further details from the journal. It appears that one of Vainchelon's sons was present at the deadly meeting, and he alone managed to escape with his life. But rather than tell of events as they happened, he kept the truth of his sire's demise a secret. Even as the man's motive boggles him, Sanson must turn his attention to his own dilemma: deciding what to do with Gylbarde's journal. Though he knows in his mind that the truth is best kept buried, in his heart he is not wholly convinced, and begs you for more time to consider the matter.

※The next bard quest will be available from Sanson upon reaching level 68."
