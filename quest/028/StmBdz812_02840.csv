53,"TEXT_STMBDZ812_02840_JASISTER02833_000_011","My sister was quite upset with me before, and rightfully so. I promised her I won't run off alone and put myself in danger, which is why I need your help."
54,"TEXT_STMBDZ812_02840_JASISTER02833_000_012","I mean to slay a group of kongamato nesting nearby, but not merely for training. No, this is for the good of all of Ala Ghiri."

66,"TEXT_STMBDZ812_02840_JNAIROH_000_051","So she's involved you in more trouble, has she? Well, I can't get mad at her for protecting the watering hole."

68,"TEXT_STMBDZ812_02840_JNAIROH_000_053","Speaking of which, curiosity got the better of me, and I asked a few of the soldiers if they knew aught of my aunt."
69,"TEXT_STMBDZ812_02840_JNAIROH_000_054","They say a woman matching her description works closely with a man named Arenvald. I plan to send her a letter, asking her to come bid her sister a final farewell."
70,"TEXT_STMBDZ812_02840_JNAIROH_000_055","If my sister finds out, she's like to run off in search of her. I hope she doesn't, but I can't stop her from living her own life. Should that day come, I'll just have to...to..."
