1,"TEXT_CLSFSH601_02895_SEQ_01","As Sisipu tells it, Master Wawalago has been acting awfully suspicious of late, sneaking surreptitiously out of the city at strange hours of the night. Concerned that the guildmaster may have gotten himself mixed up in something shady, she enlists your services in going to the man and sizing up what exactly is going on."
2,"TEXT_CLSFSH601_02895_SEQ_02","Somewhat stung to hear that Sisipu is on to him despite his best efforts to keep his secret, Master Wawalago nevertheless is quick to assure you that nothing suspicious is afoot. On the contrary, he has simply been going out to converse with a companion who seeks his counsel─a companion who, he expresses, might be eager to meet you as well. He asks you to assure Sisipu that all is well, then join him and his friend at the Gods' Grip."
3,"TEXT_CLSFSH601_02895_SEQ_03","Though not particularly pleased at Wawalago's deception and unwillingness to disclose the details of his dealings with this enigmatic acquaintance of his, Sisipu is nevertheless heartened to hear that the guildmaster is well, and that you will be accompanying him to the Gods' Grip to ensure that he doesn't get into any deeply dire straits."
4,"TEXT_CLSFSH601_02895_SEQ_04","Meeting Wawalago at the Gods' Grip, you are quickly joined by Govv, a young Sahagin who befriended Master Wawalago after ending up on the wrong end of his fishing line. Recently, Govv is gravely concerned at the sudden and surprising disappearance of a particularly striking species of fish known as “the shooting star of the seas” in the Sahagin tongue. With a clear vote of confidence from the guildmaster, Govv accepts your aid, and goes off to collect more information that could help you ascertain where the fish may have absconded to. In the meantime, Wawalago would return to Limsa before Sisipu gets wise to his current whereabouts."
5,"TEXT_CLSFSH601_02895_SEQ_05","Back at Fisherman's Bottom, Wawalago relates his rationale for keeping his dealings with Govv a secret from Sisipu. He explains that the girl's home was once raided by the Sahagin when she was young, and he seeks only to spare her from reliving the pain of her past. Stating his intention to seek out more information on the fish─such as its name in your own tongue─he encourages you to partake in a spot of fishing to further focus your mind on the task at hand.

※The next fisher quest will be available from Wawalago upon reaching level 63."

49,"TEXT_CLSFSH601_02895_SISIPU_000_001","How so, you ask? Well, first of all, he hasn't been seen chasing skirts at the Wench for nearly a whole week now. What's more, word has it he's been skulking in and out of the city at the strangest hours, tiptoeing around as if he's afraid of being seen."
50,"TEXT_CLSFSH601_02895_SISIPU_000_002","It's not like the man ever does any work around here, but he <Emphasis>is</Emphasis> the face of the guild─it wouldn't be good for business if he got himself caught up in anything untoward.

51,"TEXT_CLSFSH601_02895_SISIPU_000_005","If it weren't for his utter aversion to anything resembling honest work, I'd wonder if Wawalago wasn't moonlighting as a culinarian."

53,"TEXT_CLSFSH601_02895_WAWALAGO_000_011","Sisipu's on to me, you say!? But how could that be? Is it possible that I'm not as sly, stealthy, and surreptitious as I thought?"
54,"TEXT_CLSFSH601_02895_WAWALAGO_000_012","Don't answer that. Old Wawalago's adult enough to admit it when he's been apprehended in the act. Fact is, I've found a new friend who's been picking my brain for advice regarding a particularly puzzling predicament."

56,"TEXT_CLSFSH601_02895_WAWALAGO_000_014","Well, I suppose that settles it. Just do your friend Wawalago one favor: stop by the guild and tell Sisipu there's no cause for concern. And, ah, don't mention much more than that. Girl's got enough gnawing at her mind with guild goings-on, I reckon."

But once we delved into a discussion of our love for the ocean deep, we became keenly conscious of just how much we have in common."
66,"TEXT_CLSFSH601_02895_WAWALAGO_000_046","You see, Govv here is searching for a stunningly spectacular specimen of fish which has distressingly disappeared from the seas of La Noscea!"
67,"TEXT_CLSFSH601_02895_WAWALAGO_000_047","The shooting star of the sea─that's what the Sahagin have termed it in their tongue. Govv says that seeing whole schools of them sail through the sea with their scintillating scarlet scales is a spectacle of blissful beauty."
68,"TEXT_CLSFSH601_02895_WAWALAGO_000_048","It's a sight all the more precious 'cause of their penchant for only appearing in particular seasons. Govv reckons that they're a roaming species that migrates after mating season to lay their eggs and nurture their newborns."
69,"TEXT_CLSFSH601_02895_WAWALAGO_000_049","...At least they were, before they just packed up and puttered off to who knows where. Govv here wasn't going to take the matter reclining on his rear."

71,"TEXT_CLSFSH601_02895_GOVV_000_051","And ssso I embarked on a journey. I ssscoured the far reaches of the realm's ssseas, where the shooting ssstars once appeared in abundance, and I found a single fishing line with an inviting lure at its tip... The next thing I knew, I was reeled in by Massster Wawalago here."
72,"TEXT_CLSFSH601_02895_GOVV_000_052","Pshhh... At firssst, I was ready to gut him for having ssstolen such a beautiful creature from usss, but he assured me that he had done nothing of the sssort."
73,"TEXT_CLSFSH601_02895_WAWALAGO_000_053","Agonizes me to admit as much, but to tell the truth, I've never even laid my lookers on one of these shooting stars.

74,"TEXT_CLSFSH601_02895_WAWALAGO_000_054","At the same time, I'm the guildmaster, and I can't very well go gallivanting off to every far-flung frontier of the realm while Sisipu does all the dirty work.
