1,"TEXT_STMBDZ908_02864_SEQ_01","Berehta confesses she is too distraught to read Erart's letter, handing it to you to read in her stead. According to the missive, Erart left a gift for his mother with J'dyalani of Ala Ghiri. She has been instructed to hand over the package upon telling her it is time to “rekindle the flames of hope.” Unfit to make the journey herself, Berehta asks you to retrieve her son's parting gift. "
2,"TEXT_STMBDZ908_02864_SEQ_02","You relay the secret message to J'dyalani as described in the letter, and she presents you with a small pouch. Berehta will be excited to see what is inside."
3,"TEXT_STMBDZ908_02864_SEQ_03","Berehta opens the pouch to reveal seeds and an accompanying note. It says they are date seeds from Garlemald, and will grow even in the most barren soil. As she leaves to inform the others of what she received, a mysterious figure steps in from the shadows, and reveals himself to be the allegedly deceased Erart. He believes his countrymen will not forgive his actions, even if they were for the sake of the Resistance, and so he faked his own death. He has resigned himself to traveling abroad to continue the fight against Garlemald in a distant land. To that end, he takes his leave, knowing Coldhearth rests in good hands."
4,"TEXT_STMBDZ908_02864_SEQ_04","You find Berehta in good spirits, ready to begin planting seeds. She invites you to return to Coldhearth when the date palms have grown, to partake of the fruit born from Erart's sacrifice."
