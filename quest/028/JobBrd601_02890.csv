In order to curb the growing anti-Ala Mhigan sentiment among Gridanians, the Order of the Twin Adder has decided to dispatch Sanson's newly formed unit to investigate. Head to Nine Ivies in the East Shroud and seek out the letter's mysterious sender."

The young man claims to be descended from a soldier who fought in the Autumn War, and based on his parents' account, the tome in question is to be found somewhere in Gyr Abania. He offers to assist in the search on the condition that he is permitted to join it, and Sanson relents. Make your way now to Castrum Oriens, which lies on the region's fringes."
5,"TEXT_JOBBRD601_02890_SEQ_05","At Nourval's recommendation, Sanson decides that the unit will remain in Castrum Oriens for a while to gather information. Take a rest for now, and be ready to depart when your comrades are done making their respective inquiries.

86,"TEXT_JOBBRD601_02890_NOURVAL_000_085","(-Nourval-)In turn, I learned of it from my parents, and since then I've dreamed of poring over its pages. Alas, as it lies deep within Ala Mhigan territory, I was resigned never to have the chance."
