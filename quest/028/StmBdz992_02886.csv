1,"TEXT_STMBDZ992_02886_SEQ_01","Gundobald would like to commemorate the life of Wilred, who died fighting for the Crystal Braves. He hands you the warrior's old sword and bids you present it to Bertliana, Wilred's childhood friend."
2,"TEXT_STMBDZ992_02886_SEQ_02","Bertliana recovers from the initial shock of seeing her friend's sword to introduce herself to you. She goes on to explain that it has long been her dream to someday take one of Wilred's belongings with her to Ala Mhigo, if it was liberated during her lifetime. Bertliana sets about packing the blade up and asks you to inform Gundobald that she will soon be ready to depart."
3,"TEXT_STMBDZ992_02886_SEQ_03","Gundobald clearly thinks highly of Bertliana─noting that she has done incredibly well to overcome all the hardships she has had to endure. You are given a list containing the names of the first group that has decided to make the journey to their homeland and asked to see if they still harbor any doubts about the move."
4,"TEXT_STMBDZ992_02886_SEQ_04","Everyone you speak with has their own worries, but you are able to reassure them that everything will be fine. You head back to Gundobald to relay that the group is now ready to make tracks."

52,"TEXT_STMBDZ992_02886_GUNDOBALD_000_004","I have a mind to entrust you and Bertliana with this task. She had been friends with Wilred ever since they were but children."

57,"TEXT_STMBDZ992_02886_BERTLIANA_000_012","But where are my manners. I know we have met before, but I have yet to introduce myself. I am Bertliana. I was good friends with Wilred."
