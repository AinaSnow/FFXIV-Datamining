1,"TEXT_CLSFSH650_02897_SEQ_01","An eager and excited Wawalago explains to you that Reyna has narrowed down the possible location of the shooting stars' spawning beds to a region in the Ruby Sea. He expresses an onze of envy as he enlightens you that Reyna will be waiting in the port town of Kugane, in the far-flung land of Hingashi."
2,"TEXT_CLSFSH650_02897_SEQ_02","Reyna's reconnaissance among the local fishermen has borne fruit in the form of the true name of the Sahagin's so-called shooting stars, known to the Hingan people as the harutsuge. Unfortunately, the name was all she could garner from her conversations, as none had seen the harutsuge's schools swimming in the vicinity as of late. Reyna then suggests speaking with another tribe talented in fishing─namely the Kojin, who are well acquainted with the Far Eastern depths. Make for Tamamizu to see if these turtlish types can tell you any more about the precise location of the spawning beds."
3,"TEXT_CLSFSH650_02897_SEQ_03","After you free Govv from the Kojin fishing net in which he had unfortunately found himself, his captor conveys to you that the prized fish's place of origin is like to be found near Shoal Rock─though their numbers in the open seas have been dwindling day by day and year by year. As impassioned as ever, Govv hurls himself headfirst into the deep unknown while Reyna asks you to join her at the Isle of Bekko to form a more solid plan."
4,"TEXT_CLSFSH650_02897_SEQ_04","Reyna would have you capture a handful of harutsuge sprags in order to glean further knowledge of the cause of their disappearance. She asks you to use utmost caution in catching three from the waters near Shoal Rock."
5,"TEXT_CLSFSH650_02897_SEQ_05","You hand over the sprags to Reyna, who places them in a bucket bound for Coerthas, where she and Ansaulme would further observe their condition and behavior. Govv is overcome with joy at the sight of the tiny red fish, and expresses his appreciation to you and Reyna for your part in locating their spawning grounds. Reyna asks you to return to the guild to relay the triumphant tidings to Wawalago."
6,"TEXT_CLSFSH650_02897_SEQ_06","While Wawalago is delighted that you succeeded in finding and capturing the fish, he laments his lack of ability to assist you and Reyna further in your mission, as he has been finding it more and more frustrating to keep Sisipu at bay.

※The next fisher quest will be available from Wawalago upon reaching level 68."

49,"TEXT_CLSFSH650_02897_WAWALAGO_000_001","It is just as she thought! After they hatch, the red rovers ride the raging currents of the Ruby Sea that rush from east to west."
50,"TEXT_CLSFSH650_02897_WAWALAGO_000_002","So it is that they eventually emerge on the edge of La Noscea. Of course, the moment I mentioned this mote of information to Govv, he marched right to the coast, saying he had a mission to make for the Ruby Sea."
51,"TEXT_CLSFSH650_02897_WAWALAGO_000_003","While I appreciate his ardor, I do hope he doesn't intend to <Emphasis>swim</Emphasis> all the way there. After all, it takes schools of shooting stars twice his size quite some time to span that distance, and they have a current to carry them along!"

But any sudden sabbaticals would be strikingly suspicious, especially to the ever-skeptical Sisipu. "
53,"TEXT_CLSFSH650_02897_WAWALAGO_000_005","Anyroad, Reyna sails the seas even as we speak. You'll want to seek her out in the port town of Kugane. Oh, and do relay to her my most recognizable of regards─a rousing wink of the right eye should suffice. Hoho!"
54,"TEXT_CLSFSH650_02897_WAWALAGO_000_010","Ah, what I wouldn't sacrifice to set sail for faraway lands! To feast my belly on the fish of foreign waters, and my eyes on its foreign flowers─of the figurative female variety, that is."

57,"TEXT_CLSFSH650_02897_REYNA_000_022","Anyhow, to business. I was able to determine what the locals call the fish that best matches the description of the Sahagin's shooting stars. The most likely candidate is known as the...er, harutsuge? I still don't know if I'm pronouncing that right."
58,"TEXT_CLSFSH650_02897_REYNA_000_023","Unfortunately, all of the fishermen I spoke to insist that they haven't seen them near the shores of late. But don't worry, as I have a plan.

79,"TEXT_CLSFSH650_02897_REYNA_000_074","In the meantime, I'll hunt down a proper vessel to give our catches enough room to swim around. I'd rather not face Govv's wrath if they go belly up before he returns."
