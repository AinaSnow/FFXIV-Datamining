1,"TEXT_STMBDZ817_02845_SEQ_01","Not wishing to waste time, J'dyalani rushes off to the location described in Baut's note─northwest on the path to the Fringes."
2,"TEXT_STMBDZ817_02845_SEQ_02","A pantera was preparing to rend the life from its willing victim just as you arrived. Your battle with the beast quickly ensues, and after a furious clash of claws and steel, it is at last brought low. With a sigh of relief you help Baut to his feet."
3,"TEXT_STMBDZ817_02845_SEQ_03","Baut is less than pleased that you intervened, and your bringing J'dyalani does little to ease his frustration. When you explain that the Alliance had no intentions of executing him, he scoffs at their offer of clemency, claiming he would find another way to end his life. J'dyalani pleads with him to reconsider, reminding him that the people of Ala Ghiri care a great deal about him. As he continues to lament that he has nothing left to live for, she surprises him with what sounds oddly like a profession of love. Baut is so taken aback he can only laugh in response. The mood now lightened, he concedes to your requests and agrees to speak with the Alliance, granted J'dyalani helps him explain to the villagers he will not be put to death. As you all return to Ala Ghiri, you decide to pay a visit to Brazen Brook to share with him the good news."
4,"TEXT_STMBDZ817_02845_SEQ_04","Brazen Brook is equal parts relieved and ecstatic to see that Baut has agreed to turn himself in. Moreover, the people of Ala Ghiri have not taken arms against the Allied forces in protest. He suspects there is still lingering mistrust of the Resistance and Eorzean Alliance, but he believes that, given time, Ala Ghiri will prosper as it once did so many years ago."

66,"TEXT_STMBDZ817_02845_BAUT_000_024","Yes, by all means. Let's get married, settle down here in the village, and fill our cottage with the pitter-patter of little feet."

72,"TEXT_STMBDZ817_02845_BRAZENBROOK_000_031","What's more, public reaction to his surrender's been surprisingly calm. The last thing we need is to be fendin' off the people we came to save."
73,"TEXT_STMBDZ817_02845_BRAZENBROOK_000_032","If you hadn't shown up when you did, I'm sure they'd be chasin' us out of here with pitchforks and torches by now."
