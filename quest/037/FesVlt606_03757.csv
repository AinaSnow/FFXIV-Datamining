※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESVLT606_03757_SEQ_01","Lisette cheerily explains to you that the votes have been all but counted, and announces that the winner of the contest is none other than Bert. She bids you accompany Bert as an unbiased observer, such that you might render a sound decision on her behalf. Bert then instructs you to wait just beyond his arranged meeting spot with your masked client.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESVLT606_03757_SEQ_02","You accompany Bert─newly minted as this year's emissary of love─to visit your heretofore masked client, who reveals himself to be none other than Guildmaster Ywain of Lancers' Guild fame. Though somewhat skeptical, Ywain humors Bert's suggestion to take up woodworking, and the two of them make their way to the Carpenters' Guild where they are greeted by a skeptical Guildmaster Beatin. The ever-serious soldier stutters that he has come seeking a better understanding of love─a confession which Beatin, as is his wont, egregiously mishears and misinterprets as a desire to deeply understand <Emphasis>lumber</Emphasis>. Convinced that he has found a kindred spirit in his fellow guildmaster, Beatin whisks Ywain off to the depths of the Twelveswood, that they might bond over their newfound shared passion for the wonderful world of wood."
3,"TEXT_FESVLT606_03757_SEQ_03","His mission to find a passionate encounter for Ywain complete—at least, in the most charitable sense of the word—Bert eagerly suggests that you both return to Lady Lisette to deliver word of his triumph."
4,"TEXT_FESVLT606_03757_SEQ_04","Upon your return, Lady Lisette carefully weighs the events of the day. Though not entirely convinced at the outset, after asking your thoughts and reconsidering the matter for herself, she triumphantly declares Bert's trial a success. The passionate young man rejoices, and with her Lady Lisette's blessing, the newly crowned emissary of love steps confidently into his role as master of ceremonies for this year's Valentione's Day. Your own duty done as well, you are free to enjoy the festivities as you see fit before going forth and returning to your adventures."
