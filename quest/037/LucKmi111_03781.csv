75,"TEXT_LUCKMI111_03781_THAFFE_000_077","If you ask me, we'd be better off making them smaller. That way, they can fit in narrow shafts."

79,"TEXT_LUCKMI111_03781_MAGNUS_000_081","We were out testing 'em when your airship came down, as a matter of fact. You seem to have a habit of crashing things..."

83,"TEXT_LUCKMI111_03781_MAGNUS_000_085","Not to pry, but what's going on? You off somewhere?"

87,"TEXT_LUCKMI111_03781_RYNE_000_089","I'll be fine, thank you. I have a place to stay at the Crystarium, and don't want for anything."

93,"TEXT_LUCKMI111_03781_MAGNUS_000_095","But I for one would still be torn. If the choice were mine, I'm not sure I could bear to be parted from my family."
94,"TEXT_LUCKMI111_03781_THANCRED_000_096","No. But it's for the best. Ryne has chosen to walk her own path, and she doesn't need me under her feet."
95,"TEXT_LUCKMI111_03781_THANCRED_000_097","Besides, I have my own responsibilities, and I wouldn't be setting a very good example if I neglected them."

97,"TEXT_LUCKMI111_03781_MAGNUS_000_099","Well then, young lady... If there's anything you need─anything at all─you're to call on us. It may surprise you, but we can do more than simply offer you trolley rides."
98,"TEXT_LUCKMI111_03781_RYNE_000_100","Thank you, Magnus. Everyone."

102,"TEXT_LUCKMI111_03781_MAGNUS_000_111","When you get the chance, tell him I'm glad we had that little talk. And tell him we'll look out for the girl."
103,"TEXT_LUCKMI111_03781_THAFFE_000_115","When it comes to families, you'd think together was best, but it's not always that simple, is it? Never really thought about it, what with my parents being long gone."
104,"TEXT_LUCKMI111_03781_THAFFE_000_116","The people in this town are the closest thing to family I've got. And to be fair, I'd hate to leave them. Which is why I'm not going anywhere!"

112,"TEXT_LUCKMI111_03781_RYNE_000_151","<sigh> It's just...I always knew that everyone would leave one day. And I always hoped and prayed that we would find a way to send them home. But now that the time has come, I just feel...lost. Lost and lonely."
113,"TEXT_LUCKMI111_03781_RYNE_000_152","I don't want our last moments together to be sad. I want to hold myself together, just long enough to say the things that I need to say. But I'm not sure I can even do that..."
