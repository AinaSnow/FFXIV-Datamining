1,"TEXT_LUCKMI105_03775_SEQ_01","While he and the others tend to the black-masked Ascians, Thancred bids you join Y'shtola at Anamnesis Anyder as a precautionary measure. To get there, you will need to secure a boat at Venmont Yards─just as soon as you've doled out Tataru's bread, that is."
2,"TEXT_LUCKMI105_03775_SEQ_02","At Venmont Yards, a shipwright recognizes you at once and happily agrees to ready a boat for you.

※In the event that you leave the instance, you may reenter by speaking with the idle shipwright."
3,"TEXT_LUCKMI105_03775_SEQ_03","To your dismay, you arrive at Anyder to find Y'shtola unconscious. Before you can go to her aid, however, Elidibus appears and spirits her away. If you want your comrade back, it seems you must treat the Ascian to a demonstration of your strength. With no other recourse, you grit your teeth and prepare to enter the aetherial stream."
4,"TEXT_LUCKMI105_03775_SEQ_04","You ride the aether to emerge in Emet-Selch's phantom Amaurot, where Elidibus instructs you to fight your way to the Capitol. The trial pits you against recreations of myriad faces from your past, and at the last the Ascian himself enters the fray in the guise of Ardbert─yet it soon becomes plain that even he is overmatched."
5,"TEXT_LUCKMI105_03775_SEQ_05","No sooner does your trial conclude than Y'shtola arrives at your side, having apparently freed herself. Gazing upon Elidibus with a mixture of pity and scorn, she proceeds to expose him for what he truly is: a primal, granted strength by the desire for salvation. Thus has he sought to inspire the masses to rise up as Warriors of Light. Unmoved, the Ascian coolly confirms Y'shtola's theories, but when she subsequently questions whether the many voices that sustain him have irrevocably changed his own, his expression hardens. No matter how much he should forget, he declares, he will always remember his duty. With that, he vanishes, but not before serving notice of his intent to gain the power to defeat you."
6,"TEXT_LUCKMI105_03775_SEQ_06","The danger now passed, you finally have the chance to apprise Y'shtola of recent events. Having listened to your tale, she goes to collect her possessions from Anyder in preparation for your journey to Eulmore."
