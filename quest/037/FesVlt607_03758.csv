0,"TEXT_FESVLT607_03758_SEQ_00","Lisette has an important announcement to share with one and all.
※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESVLT607_03758_SEQ_01","Lisette cheerily explains to you that the votes have been all but counted, and announces that the winner of the contest is none other than Rodrigault. She bids you accompany Rodrigault as an unbiased observer, such that you might render a sound decision on her behalf. Rodrigault then instructs you to wait just beyond his arranged meeting spot with your masked client.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESVLT607_03758_SEQ_02","You accompany Rodrigault—newly minted as this year's emissary of love—to visit your heretofore masked client, who reveals himself to be none other than Guildmaster Ywain of Lancers' Guild fame. With some skepticism, Ywain agrees to take part in a meditation exercise at Rodrigault's suggestion, and the two of them make their way to Stillglade Fane where they are greeted by Brother E–Sumi–Yan. Their conversation is suddenly interrupted by Sylphie, however, who astutely ascertains precisely what sort of love the guildmaster <Emphasis>truly</Emphasis> seeks, and begins to lecture him on matters including personal hygiene, whisking him off to the Twelve know where that she might transform him into a less offensively odored individual."
3,"TEXT_FESVLT607_03758_SEQ_03","Cool and confident as always despite the unexpected turn of events, Rodrigault observes that his approach did indeed spark an encounter that has the potential to reverse your client's fortunes. He strides confidently off to report his clear success to Lady Lisette, with the clear expectation that you will be along in tow."
4,"TEXT_FESVLT607_03758_SEQ_04","Upon your return, Lady Lisette carefully weighs the events of the day. Though not entirely convinced at the outset, after asking your thoughts and reconsidering the matter for herself, she triumphantly declares Rodrigault's trial a success. The studious scholar of love rejoices in his own subdued way, and with Lady Lisette's blessing, the newly crowned emissary of love steps into his role as master of ceremonies for this year's Valentione's Day. Your own duty done as well, you are free to enjoy the festivities as you see fit before going forth and returning to your adventures."

51,"TEXT_FESVLT607_03758_LISETTE_000_002","A rather unique approach, to be sure. That said, from the moment you told me that Rodrigault's proposal had your support, I had a hunch that he might somehow emerge the victor."

96,"TEXT_FESVLT607_03758_LISETTE_000_062","Indeed...I suppose it does, my friend! After all, if young Sylphie provides the guildmaster with the wisdom he needs, and he proceeds to take it to heart, there is no telling how charming and handsome of a gentleman he might become!"
97,"TEXT_FESVLT607_03758_LISETTE_000_063","...I suppose you are correct. Guildmaster Ywain was looking for a new encounter. While young Sylphie might not be suitable as the object of his affections, perhaps this meeting can be the spark that leads to a change in the man's romantic fortunes."
