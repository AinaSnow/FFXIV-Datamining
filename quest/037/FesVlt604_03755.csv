0,"TEXT_FESVLT604_03755_SEQ_00","Rodrigault eyes you with an expression of supreme self-assurance.
※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESVLT604_03755_SEQ_01","You speak with Rodrigault, and inform him that his logical analysis of the situation has won you over. Seeing this as merely the natural progression of events, he casually walks off to report to Lisette while barely acknowledging your presence. While there is no end of places you would rather be, you resolve to follow him and honor your promise to Lisette.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESVLT604_03755_SEQ_02","Though she professes to remain impartial, Lady Lisette's weary expression betrays her dismay that you have chosen to support this haughty academic over her dear sister. The contest is far from over, however, as many votes remain to be counted. You resolve to enjoy the festivities as you wait for Lady Lisette and her colleagues to declare a victor."

59,"TEXT_FESVLT604_03755_RODRIGAULT_000_007","Precisely...he had no answer. A man who cannot answer such a simple query is a man who has lost sight of himself and what he truly seeks from life."
60,"TEXT_FESVLT604_03755_RODRIGAULT_000_008","That is why I intend to propose that our man spend some time at Stillglade Fane when he is off duty.

64,"TEXT_FESVLT604_03755_BERT_000_012","I am not such a petty man as to begrudge you your right to cast your lot with another. But mark my words─you will regret not backing the winning chocobo when Bert the Beloved's proposal carries the day!"

66,"TEXT_FESVLT604_03755_LISETTE_000_021","One vote for Rodrigault it is! No doubt his dispassionate deductions were most convincing. I can only hope they satisfy our anonymous client as well as they satisfy the man who dreamed them up."
67,"TEXT_FESVLT604_03755_LISETTE_000_022","Mind you, it is far too early to declare the contest won. There are countless other adventurers and Gridanian citizens who have yet to weigh in, after all. When the final results have been counted and compiled, pray speak with me anew."
