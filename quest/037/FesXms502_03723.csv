※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESXMS502_03723_SEQ_01","Amh Garanjy cheerfully reports to you that Lartonphe and his chocobo companion are prepared to take the stage whenever you are. She further elaborates that the crowd is being divided into two groups, with a Starlight celebrant assigned to each. For better or worse, the festival staff have wildly differing approaches in their pre-perfomance banter, with one guide exaggerating the musical ability of the choir to ridiculous extremes. As a result, that particular group's expectations are considerably higher than the other, and a more complex and challenging song is required to satisfy them. Thankfully, you are free to choose which collective of spectators you will perform for first.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESXMS502_03723_SEQ_02","Thanks to Lartonphe's soaringly sonorous voice, his chocobo companion's charming cavorting, and─last but certainly not least─your skilled direction, the Starlight concert was a resounding success. As warmth fills the hearts and smiles adorn the faces of all in the audience, you seek out Nalipponcque to hear his impressions of his father's inspired performance."
3,"TEXT_FESXMS502_03723_SEQ_03","Nalipponcque, as hoped, was simply overjoyed with the performance, and even happier to discover that his father is friends with a most charming specimen of his favorite bird. Moved by the words of his dearest son, Lartonphe expresses remorse for his deception, asking the boy to forgive him. Nalipponcque requires no apology, and his mood brightens even further when he is offered a ride atop his father's feathered companion. His friends soon join him, and all present share in the warmth of the moment. Nalipponcque then surprises his father by expressing an interest in music, asking if he, too, might learn how to sing. The surprised quiverman happily acquiesces, and the chocobo joins in the fun by demonstrating how easy and fun it is to raise one's voice in song. United by their love of chocobos and music, the family shares in a Starlight miracle that will be one to remember."
