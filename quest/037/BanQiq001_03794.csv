As she tells it, her son Valan─who you had some dealings with in the past─has once again run off with Quinfort, a would-be prophet with a penchant for the dramatic. She bids you go in search for the young man, lest he and his friend wander off too far and get themselves in trouble.

2,"TEXT_BANQIQ001_03794_SEQ_02","Searching the forest, you come upon Quinfort and a visibly frustrated Valan. The latter is expressing his frustration with his friend's predilection for dashing off at a moment's notice with scarcely a word of explanation when─lo and behold─Quinfort is struck with another vision, and promptly dashes off deep into the forest. With an audible sigh, Valan turns to you and asks that you join him in surveying the area for any sign of the impulsive prognosticator."
3,"TEXT_BANQIQ001_03794_SEQ_03","You succeed in tracking down Quinfort, who stands before a curious scene: two ratlike creatures─one old, one young─being threatened at spearpoint by a couple of Viis guards. The two introduce themselves as Qitarl Natl and Chaqurl Qhotl of the Qitari, a mouselike tribe that once served the Empire of Ronka as scribes and scriveners before being driven to the depths of the forest at the time of the Flood. Having emerged from their hundred-year exile, they now seek to unearth the Qitari stelae─massive stone tablets engraved with records of their accumulated knowledge and history, and in doing so reclaim their legacy. They are accompanied by a small, squirmy creature that is the spitting image of the Great Serpent of Ronka who Quinfort so loyally serves. The serpent then dashes off with an excited “scree,” leading the Qitari duo and Quinfort alike to conclude that the divine protector is leading them to the relic they seek. Should you be so inclined, follow along and join them in the search."
4,"TEXT_BANQIQ001_03794_SEQ_04","You find the Qitari and their serpent standing near a sealed cave entrance. It is here, according to Qitarl Natl, that his forefathers stored away the stone tablets for safekeeping before fleeing the forest some one hundred years ago. He further elaborates that breaking the seal will require a relic of ancient Ronka─or more specifically, a stone housing immense aetherial power, and entreats your assistance in searching for one. You resolve to ponder their offer, and to speak with Qitarl again should you be inclined to cooperate."
5,"TEXT_BANQIQ001_03794_SEQ_05","Qitarl rejoices at your generous offer of aid, his long-held wish of reclaiming his tribe's legacy finally within reach. Quinfort, struck with another burst of possibly divine inspiration, offers his hypothesis that the striped pattern on the great serpent's body might indeed be a clue as to the location of the stone you seek. Questioning his sanity but having nowhere else to turn, you strike out in search of the ancient relic that may grant you and your newfound Qitari friends passage into the cavern."
6,"TEXT_BANQIQ001_03794_SEQ_06","You succeed in finding the stone and delivering it safely to Chaqurl Qhotl. Quinfort's ramblings again prove remarkably prophetic when the engraved slab sealing the cave's entrance gives way, granting passage to the grottoes and tunnels within. The Qitari explorers jump for joy, unable to contain their excitement at the discoveries that doubtless lie ahead. They resolve to call for a select group of their fellow tribesmen to assist in the excavation effort, which will be conducted on a grand scale. Should you be of a mind to aid the self-styled Stewards of Note in pursuing their life's work, they will surely welcome your continued presence at their camp in Hopl's Stopple."
