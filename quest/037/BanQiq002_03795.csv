Alas, there is one small complication: the presence of an arcane ward preventing access to the inner chambers that is passable only by servants of Ox'Dalan, protector of the underworld. As all present ponder a suitable course of action, the Great Serpent of Ronka lets forth a great scree, no doubt seeking to impart wisdom to your band. Sadly, no one present is able to comprehend the meaning of the divine protector's words, leaving you no choice but to accompany Chaqurl Qhotl to Slitherbough to seek the aid of the one man who can.

The stone, however, has been weathered over the ages, obscuring key passages necessary to comprehend the writings in full. At the exhortation of the great serpent, the Qitari resolve to restore the tablets to the best of their ability. However, the missing text leaves many passages open for interpretation, and Qitarl Natl and his son Chaqurl Qhotl have differing views about the intended message.

Lying beside the shattered stone were several sad piles of bones─no doubt the remains of our once-proud forefathers who carried the stelae down below. I shudder to think of their last moments, torn apart by sin eaters as they hid away our legacy for safekeeping."

138,"TEXT_BANQIQ002_03795_QITARLNATL_000_108","In truth, it appeared and spoke to us just as we stood before the shattered stone. I cannot help but believe it was conveying to us a message, just as its brethren guided us to these ancient tunnels."
139,"TEXT_BANQIQ002_03795_QITARLNATL_000_109","Chaqurl and I pondered the matter, and we believe that we understand. The great serpent bids us to unearth what remains of the scattered and weathered stelae, and piece together our people's history anew with our own hands and minds."

141,"TEXT_BANQIQ002_03795_QUINFORT_000_111","Yet surely you must have been able to make out something from what remained of the stone! What chronicles of eld were writ there!?"
142,"TEXT_BANQIQ002_03795_QITARLNATL_000_112","...Ahem. What we were able to make of the markings could be described thus: a mighty Ronso wearing a crown─no doubt meant to represent the first emperor of Ronka, stood tall with a blade raised high over his head."
143,"TEXT_BANQIQ002_03795_QITARLNATL_000_113","Before him, cowered a Qitari─one of our forefathers, no doubt. The carving would seem to depict the momentous occasion that was the first encounter between our people and the empire."
144,"TEXT_BANQIQ002_03795_QITARLNATL_000_114","And the implications could not be more clear. Doubtless our ancestors, ill-suited for battle, were conquered and subjugated by the might of Ronka, under whose yoke they would find new purpose as the stewards of history."
145,"TEXT_BANQIQ002_03795_CHAQURLQHOTL_000_115","A most fascinating interpretation, Father. But if I might be so bold, I saw the drawings quite differently."
146,"TEXT_BANQIQ002_03795_CHAQURLQHOTL_000_116","I do not believe the Ronkan emperor would be so cruel as to threaten the poor, weak Qitari. No, I believe that he found us vulnerable and at the mercy of the fearsome beasts of the forest. He slew the beasts by his own hand, and befriended our ancestors, giving us new purpose as his subjects."
147,"TEXT_BANQIQ002_03795_QITARLNATL_000_117","Your optimism is admirable, my boy, but I fear that such a bright and cheery interpretation of events is unlikely at best. History is full of harsh truths from which we must not avert our eyes."

149,"TEXT_BANQIQ002_03795_VALAN_000_119","If you ask me, both theories seem reasonable. But if you intend to keep a record of history to pass down to posterity, you're going to have to choose one."
