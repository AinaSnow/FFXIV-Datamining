56,"TEXT_LUCKMI110_03780_ALPHINAUD_000_022","Given his conversance with the idiosyncrasies of the fae folk, I doubt it will be an issue, but a small part of me worries that they may not relinquish him willingly. As such, I would feel better if you were to look in on our friend─assuming you have the time, of course."
57,"TEXT_LUCKMI110_03780_ALPHINAUD_000_023","I still need to say my farewells to a few others here. Pray look in on Urianger, and I shall see you at the Crystarium."

59,"TEXT_LUCKMI110_03780_URIANGER_000_031","So thou wouldst grant the Exarch a final tour of the realm which hath been his home these hundred years? A noble gesture."
60,"TEXT_LUCKMI110_03780_URIANGER_000_032","As for Master Alphinaud's concerns, thou may'st rest assured that all is well here. Far from detaining me, our fae friends have agreed to assist in the transportation of these tomes unto the Cabinet of Curiosity. Naught more remaineth to be done."
61,"TEXT_LUCKMI110_03780_URIANGER_000_033","Regardless, 'tis well that thou didst come, for I had been meaning to show something to thee."

63,"TEXT_LUCKMI110_03780_URIANGER_000_035","Though it hath lost its radiance, 'tis unmistakably a Crystal of Light. One that did, in all likelihood, once belong to Ardbert."

65,"TEXT_LUCKMI110_03780_URIANGER_000_036","And when his mortal form was─forgive mine indelicacy─consumed by thy foe to fuel his transformation, I posit that the crystal did tumble free."
66,"TEXT_LUCKMI110_03780_URIANGER_000_037","Save that which doth abide in thee, it is all that remaineth of our friend. And if thou art willing, I would have thee deliver it unto Seto. I can think of no worthier recipient than he─and no more fitting a bearer than thee."
67,"TEXT_LUCKMI110_03780_URIANGER_000_038","As ever, thou wilt find the amaro in Wolekdorf. My thanks, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."
68,"TEXT_LUCKMI110_03780_URIANGER_000_040","The crystal shall grant Seto a measure of comfort, I believe. And to receive of it from thee shall only add to its meaning."

74,"TEXT_LUCKMI110_03780_URIANGER_000_071","...Remarkable. 'Twas fated that thou shouldst be the one to undertake this task, I think."
75,"TEXT_LUCKMI110_03780_URIANGER_000_072","As Ardbert liveth on in thee, so too shall he and his comrades live on in the hearts of the people of Norvrandt."
