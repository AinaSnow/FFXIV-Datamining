66,"TEXT_SUBCTS640_03729_ANFRIGG_000_044","All three of us are orphans, so we had to stick together to survive. We shared everything we had, right down to our last crust of...well, whatever was available."
67,"TEXT_SUBCTS640_03729_ZIABOSTA_000_045","That's why we promised each other that we'd find a way into Eulmore, no matter what it took. But Anfrigg and I were chosen, while Kai-Shirr was left behind. I can't tell you how glad we were to be reunited with him after so long apart!"

83,"TEXT_SUBCTS640_03729_KAISHIRR_000_066","Seems to me that under Vauthry, Eulmorans forgot what it means to actually work for a living, and most of the old industries disappeared altogether. Still, there are a few things left over from those days that we can put to good use."
84,"TEXT_SUBCTS640_03729_MANAGER03729_000_067","Such as?"

86,"TEXT_SUBCTS640_03729_KAISHIRR_100_068","Eulmorans ain't the only ones who like to have a good old knees-up, you know! If we open up the “city of final pleasures” to visitors, we'll be raking in the gil!"

88,"TEXT_SUBCTS640_03729_KAISHIRR_000_070","'Course, word of mouth will only get us so far."
89,"TEXT_SUBCTS640_03729_KAISHIRR_000_071","But if you put me in charge of promoting your establishment, I'll do whatever it takes to bring in people from every corner of Norvrandt!"
90,"TEXT_SUBCTS640_03729_MOWEN_000_072","I say! Your enthusiasm is positively infectious! And for a self-confessed amateur, I find you <Emphasis>remarkably</Emphasis> persuasive..."

92,"TEXT_SUBCTS640_03729_MANAGER03729_000_074","Yes, this is certainly in line with Master Chai's aim to foster trade with outsiders. And as far as I can see, the Beehive stands only to gain from this most worthy of endeavors."
93,"TEXT_SUBCTS640_03729_MANAGER03729_000_075","I am therefore placing you in charge of advertising the Beehive!"

103,"TEXT_SUBCTS640_03729_KAISHIRR_000_102","Still, if I'm to advertise a place like the Beehive, I suppose I've got to look the part. Not that it really matters for our first task, though."
104,"TEXT_SUBCTS640_03729_KAISHIRR_000_103","While I was getting measured for my outfit, I was thinking of how we could convince everyone to come and spend their hard-earned coin in the Beehive."
105,"TEXT_SUBCTS640_03729_KAISHIRR_000_104","Rather than shouting from the rooftops, it'd be a lot easier if we gave out flyers everywhere. I ain't just talking about a handful though."
106,"TEXT_SUBCTS640_03729_KAISHIRR_000_105","I'll need hundreds, and that means I'll need paper, ink, and something to print them with. That last one's the trickiest, but it'll speed things up like no one's business. Do you think you could get those for me?"
107,"TEXT_SUBCTS640_03729_KAISHIRR_000_106","There was one other thing... Oh right, payment! 'Course, I ain't expecting you to do it for free. I'll be getting scrips and whatnot from Mowen, so I'll send a few your way."
