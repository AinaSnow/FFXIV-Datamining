1,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_SEQ_01","In distressed tones, Noalle informs you that an inquisitor has come and taken her mother away. Without delay, you rush off towards the Arc of the Worthy, to Audaine's aid."
2,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_SEQ_02","You arrive to find not only Audaine and the inquisitor, but a dragon and dragonet unsuccessfully trying to gain entry into the Holy See. It is revealed that the dragon is none other than Audaine's husband, Marcelloix, whom the inquisitor is determined to punish as a heretic. However, Francel reminds him that, under new laws, those accused of heresy are to be accorded fair hearing, and volunteers to take Marcelloix and the dragonet, Ehll Tou, into his care. The tense confrontation thus ended, you all make your way to the Firmament to further discuss the situation."
3,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_SEQ_03","Back at the Firmament, you consider what might be done with Marcelloix, who, as a heretic and dragon both, places his family in a difficult situation. Having once been abandoned by her husband, Audaine is understandably upset, and asks for time to decide whether or not she will take him back. Having had a gutful of men's troubles, the dragonet, Ehll Tou, flies off on her own to see the district, and Francel bids you go after her lest she cause alarm among the residents."
4,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_SEQ_04","You find Ehll Tou watching the residents of the Firmament with great interest, but otherwise doing no harm. With some convincing, you succeed in persuading the dragonet to rejoin the others at Saint Roelle's Dais."
5,"TEXT_LUCKHA103_03727_SEQ_05","Francel has informed the residents of the Firmament of your draconic guests. Yet while all now understand the situation, whether they accept it is another question. At that moment, two citizens approach Francel and voice their aversion towards the man-turned-dragon. At the young lord's behest, they grudgingly withhold their judgment, but Marcelloix is made to be keenly aware that his is an unwelcome presence."
