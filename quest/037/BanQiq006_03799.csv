1,"TEXT_BANQIQ006_03799_SEQ_01","At Hopl's Stopple, Chaqurl Qhotl reflects upon recent events in the Greatwood. While he regrets the role his people played in spreading the sickness about the forest, he is heartened that the Qitari contributed to stopping the spread of the disease through the wisdom of their forefathers. But this triumph was not achieved alone, and Chaqurl would thank his friends who dwell throughout the wood for their aid and support in a time of need. You resolve to first accompany him to Fanow, where he would express his gratitude to Master Lanille and the Viis.

After sharing word on the recent goings-on in the forest, you learn that Phyna has finally resolved to depart on her journey, and together with Ciuna, you see her off with a smile. Saying farewell to the Viis, you set out for Slitherbough, where your friends Valan and Quinfort await."

Though he remains skeptical of Quinfort's ramblings, it has become difficult to deny that the priest-in-training's prognostications have proved true to some extent. Chaqurl Qhotl, for his part, would convey his thanks to the great serpent, and Quinfort is more than happy to propose a suitable venue for doing so. You resolve to accompany the young Qitari to Lake Tusi Mek'ta, where he intends to pay his respects."

6,"TEXT_BANQIQ006_03799_SEQ_06","Back at Hopl's Stopple, both father and son reflect on the events of the day and the history they have reclaimed, and muse about the merits of continuing the excavation, as well as recording and preserving all to be passed down to posterity. Thanking you profusely, Qitarl Natl even suggests that they might carve a new stela with imagery depicting the fateful meeting between the Qitari and the ally of Ronka. Saying your farewells for the moment, you resolve to return again when your journey takes you to the Greatwood, that you might hear and learn more about the wonders of history they will doubtless continue to unearth."
