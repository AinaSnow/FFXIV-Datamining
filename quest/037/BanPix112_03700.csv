54,"TEXT_BANPIX112_03700_UINNEE_000_023","And since we won't be boating on real water, as long as we can conjure up something that at least <Emphasis>looks</Emphasis> like a boat, it should be fine. Oh yes, we'll have the finest adventures with the children on the ocean blue! ...It <Emphasis>is</Emphasis> blue, isn't it?"
