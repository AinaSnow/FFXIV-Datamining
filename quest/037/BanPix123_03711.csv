Then I hid in a log for five days and five nights, and no one found me. It was <Emphasis>amazing</Emphasis>! Then I got bored, so I came back."
49,"TEXT_BANPIX123_03711_UINNEE_000_002","Anyway, while I was there, it occurred to me that the children in the Rak'tika Greatwood aren't usually allowed to leave their villages. And that means that they can't make hideouts! I mean, sure, they could hide <Emphasis>in</Emphasis> the village, but people would find them."
50,"TEXT_BANPIX123_03711_UINNEE_000_003","And it doesn't count if other people can find it, right? Right!? If any old adult can stumble across it, that's not a hideout, that's just <Emphasis>sad</Emphasis>."
51,"TEXT_BANPIX123_03711_UINNEE_000_004","I decided right then and there that I would dream up a perfect hiding place for those poor little darlings.

52,"TEXT_BANPIX123_03711_UINNEE_000_005","Tragically, Father Collard's Chambers is absolutely swarming with the lawless ones, which makes it impossible to harvest mushroom spawn. If something isn't done, my brilliant plan will never come to fruition, and...I'm sure you can see where this is going. Do it for the children!"

55,"TEXT_BANPIX123_03711_UINNEE_000_021","Oh, well done! Such a clever mortal you are. We should be able to grow this one nice and tall, then pop it into a dream, and...voila! Greatest hideout ever. We don't even need to put it in a dank old cave! Imagine the possibilities..."
