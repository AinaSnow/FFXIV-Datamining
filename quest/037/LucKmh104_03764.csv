1,"TEXT_LUCKMH104_03764_SEQ_01","Lyna thanks you for a candid discussion of her concerns for the Crystal Exarch. She then bids you return to the Crystarium, where the Scions are no doubt anxious for your return."
2,"TEXT_LUCKMH104_03764_SEQ_02","With the threat of an Eighth Umbral Calamity averted, and Lord Vauthry's reign at an end, the people of Norvrandt now strive to build a new future for themselves. To that end, some have begun to seek truth in the past: they wish to understand the Flood which nearly consumed their world, as well as the role the Warriors of Light played in bringing it about. Alphinaud believes that the Scions should aid the people in this endeavor and divulge what they know to those willing to listen. He asks you and the others to fan out and invite the people of the Crystarium to the Exedra, after which you will then give them an accurate account of what happened all those years ago."
3,"TEXT_LUCKMH104_03764_SEQ_03","You and the Scions cover near every ilm of the Crystarium, and have garnered the curiosity of no few residents. All that remains is to await their arrival at the Exedra."
4,"TEXT_LUCKMH104_03764_SEQ_04","You expound the deeds of the Warriors of Light and the events leading up to the Flood, careful not to overlook even the smallest detail. The people of the Crystarium are moved by your words, and as you look out over the crowd, you spy a frighteningly familiar face─Ardbert. Soon finding himself the center of attention, he proclaims it was the will of the star that brought him back from the beyond, and that his purpose now is to guide the people of Norvrandt to become Warriors of Light themselves. But while the crowd hangs on his every word, the Scions stand apart, unconvinced. Rather than confront him openly, Urianger suggests you retire to the Ocular.

Considering the events leading to Emet-Selch's demise, there is no question you have been faced with an impostor. The Scions conclude that it must be an Ascian ploy, and to your knowledge only Elidibus remains to employ such a tactic. But to what end would he encourage the birth of new Warriors of Light?"
