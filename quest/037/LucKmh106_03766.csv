68,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_YSHTOLA_000_042","Though I must say, I think I did rather well for not having a broom thus far."

86,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_ALISAIE_000_065","Well, we're all agreed that this is just another Ascian ploy, yes?"
87,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_ALISAIE_000_066","They've commandeered corpses before, and to no good end. I see no reason to think this time is any different─especially when it's that of a fallen Warrior of Light."
88,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_ALPHINAUD_000_067","I doubt we'll learn more if we remain a step behind."
89,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_URIANGER_000_068","His next destination is, in all likelihood, Slitherbough..."
90,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_YSHTOLA_000_069","Alisaie, are you certain you should be here?"
91,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_ALISAIE_000_070","If you're concerned about Halric and the others, you needn't be. Their treatment is going well, but progress is slow and exhausting─for all of us. The best thing I can do now is let them rest. So─I believe we were about to discuss how to arrange a meeting with our would-be Warrior of Light?"
92,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_ALPHINAUD_000_071","Before visiting any towns or villages, Ardbert would hunt down and slay a nearby sin eater to earn the locals' trust."
93,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_ALPHINAUD_000_072","Our best chance of getting ahead of him is to find one before he does."

98,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_RUNAR_000_077","I...er... A warm bowl of stew will be awaiting your return."

100,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_RUNAR_000_080","Please, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, I beg of you... Keep her safe..."
101,"TEXT_LUCKMH106_03766_RYNE_000_081","I can sense no other sin eaters in the area. I hope this means Ardbert will be coming this way soon."
