1,"TEXT_BANQIQ004_03797_SEQ_01","You engage in a stimulating conversation with the Great Serpent of Ronka, who─you surmise from the urgency and eagerness of its screeing─is keen to see the Stewards press deeper into the tunnels of Hopl's Stopple. Should you be inclined to heed his call, seek out Chaqurl Qhotl and see how you might best proceed.

Seeking passage further down in the depths beneath Hopl's Stopple, the Qitari excavation team's path was blocked by a massive water vein. Suffering severe chills in attempting to navigate the icy flow, Towarl Manol has taken ill and lies incapacitated in bed. Hoping to aid their friend, the Qitari father and son once again summon Valan and Quinfort from Slitherbough. The two suggest fashioning a traditional remedy and something to keep the bedridden Qitari warm, and entrust you with the task of finding a vital material for the latter. You resolve to go forth and do your part to keep your Qitari friends in comfort."

The Qitari rejoice when it proves not only a lifesaver for the ailing Towarl, but also─thanks to a burst of inspiration from the young Chaqurl─affords the Stewards a way to traverse the frigid depths in search of the next stela. Trusting the two Night's Blessed with looking after Towarl, Qitarl and his son continue their exploration of the underground tunnels. What wonders did they unearth this time?"
4,"TEXT_BANQIQ004_03797_SEQ_04","At Hopl's Stopple─feeling more comfortable and welcoming than ever thanks to the supplies and conveniences brought from Slitherbough─Qitarl and Chaqurl triumphantly inform you that they have succeeded in discovering the third stela. Unfortunately but unsurprisingly, it appears to be as weathered and worn as the others. Nevertheless, the Qitari father and son have each come to their own theories regarding the meaning of the markings, which depict what appears to be a curious race of fishmen. At the behest of the Stewards, it once again falls to you to weigh in on the matter and choose which version of history will be passed on to posterity..."
