※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESVLT601_03752_SEQ_01","Lady Lisette de Valentione greets you and welcomes you to the Valentione's Day festivities, which have returned to Gridania anew this year. Though she wishes nothing more than to spread ardor and affection─as her house words are writ─across all of Eorzea, she finds herself in the midst of a most disheartening dispute. To wit, her three would-be protégés─including her sister Astrid, to whom Lisette is partial─are bickering over which of them most deserves to assume the role of emissary of love for this year's festival. To that end, Lady Lisette proposes a contest: the three will listen to the plight of a lovelorn Gridanian and each offer their advice, after which a vote will be held, and the most insightful and inspired of the three declared the victor. Tasked with seeing that the competition proceeds with due impartiality, you agree to accompany the three would-be emissaries to interview their subject.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESVLT601_03752_SEQ_02","Together with Lady Lisette's three compatriots─the ambitious Astrid, the brash-yet-bold Bert, and the restrained Rodrigault─you approach the Gridanian whose lonely heart the three will compete to provide succor. Though he insists on keeping his true identity a secret, he is more than forthcoming with details regarding his struggles in finding his eternal love. Enlightened as to the nature of the man's plight by both his own words and additional details offered by Rodrigault, the three emissaries split up to ponder the matter and formulate a plan of action. Speak to each of them and see what words of wisdom they intend to offer the yearning young man."
3,"TEXT_FESVLT601_03752_SEQ_03","Astrid, Bert, and Rodrigault in turn convey to you with supreme confidence the advice they plan to offer the lovesick lad, each seeming utterly convinced that they can count on your support in the forthcoming vote. Needless to say, you can only pick one of the three to support. You resolve to weigh your options well as you head back to the amphitheatre to report to Lady Lisette."
4,"TEXT_FESVLT601_03752_SEQ_04","You report to Lady Lisette, who is tickled pink to hear that all three of her protégés are approaching the contest in earnest. She further informs you that the preparations for the Valentione's Ceremony have been completed, and that─should you yourself be in search of true love─you are welcome to take part in it whenever you desire. She encourages you to enjoy the festivities to your heart's content before rendering your decision as to which of her three colleagues you wish to support. When your decision is made, seek out the emissary of your choice where they await you in Old Gridania, that you might assure them of your support."
