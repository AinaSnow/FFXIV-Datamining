1,"TEXT_LUCKMI112_03782_SEQ_01","Having bade the people of the Crystarium an emotional farewell, the moment has come for your fellow Scions to depart for the Source. Together with Ryne, you make your way to the Ocular, where your friends have gathered for the final time."
2,"TEXT_LUCKMI112_03782_SEQ_02","The air is heavy with anticipation as you take your place in the chamber, and you try unsuccessfully not to think about all the things that could go wrong. After a moment's hesitation, you give the signal to proceed, and Beq Lugg commences the ritual, directing the Scions to commit first their memories to the spirit vessels, and then their very souls. The deed duly done, the crystals and their precious contents are entrusted to your safekeeping. All that remains is for you to step into the mirror and see your friends home."
3,"TEXT_LUCKMI112_03782_SEQ_03","It is an otherwise ordinary day when you throw open the doors of the Rising Stones and step into its familiar surrounds, but the Twelve know your purpose is anything but ordinary. A few words are enough to convey this fact to Krile and Tataru, who share a tense look before ushering you to the infirmary. The spirit vessels safely in place, you wait with bated breath...and heave a sigh of relief as, one by one, your friends awaken in their own bodies once more. As far as you have come, however, one soul remains to be restored to its rightful home, and thus do you return to the road, bound for the beacon of hope that gleams in the distance...

Some days later, it is with great jubilation that the Scions welcome a new addition to their ranks: a bright-eyed youth named G'raha Tia. And together with comrades old and new, you set your sights upon the many adventures still to come."

Yet whatever may lie ahead, and whatever hardships you may face, you have faith that your experiences in the First will give you the strength to forge ever onward."
