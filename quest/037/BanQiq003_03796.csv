※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANQIQ003_03796_SEQ_01","You engage in a stimulating conversation with the Great Serpent of Ronka, who─you surmise from the urgency and eagerness of its screeing─is keen to see the Stewards press deeper into the tunnels of Hopl's Stopple. Should you be inclined to heed its call, seek out Chaqurl Qhotl and see how you might best proceed.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANQIQ003_03796_SEQ_02","You seek out and speak with Chaqurl Qhotl. It appears that further progress through the tunnels of Hopl's Stopple will require you to perform a ceremony in obeisance to Ox'Dalan, god of death and protector of the underworld. Qitarl Natl suggests that perhaps the Viis, as a fellow ancient race with ties to Ronka, might be able to offer apt advice in the matter. Finding his reasoning sound, you agree to accompany Chaqurl Qhotl to Fanow in search of wisdom."
3,"TEXT_BANQIQ003_03796_SEQ_03","Your old friends Ciuna and Phyna bid you welcome in your return to Fanow. After reminiscing about her friendship with one of Chaqurl's ancestors, Master Lanille enlightens you with the knowledge that a traditional Viis ritual may serve to appease Ox'Dalan and offer the Qitari excavation team passage to the tunnels below. At the Viis' request, you set out to procure an item suitable for use as an offering to the gods of old."
4,"TEXT_BANQIQ003_03796_SEQ_04","Back at Hopl's Stopple, all rejoice at your success in tracking down the offering for the ritual, which─with the help of Chaqurl Qhotl, who has diligently learned the accompanying prayer from Master Lanille─proceeds without a hitch. At long last, the second phase of the excavation may begin. After a short while spent waiting, the Qitari father and son return...what, pray tell, did they find on their expedition?"
5,"TEXT_BANQIQ003_03796_SEQ_05","Qitarl and Chaqurl reveal that they have managed to locate the second Qitari stela which, unfortunately, is in the same shabby shape as the first one they discovered. This one appears to depict the first encounter between the Qitari and the Viis, but─not unlike last time─the father and son have different ideas about how the weathered markings should be interpreted. At the urging of yet another incarnation of the Great Serpent of Ronka─or so it appears to be─you are charged with mediating between the two and choosing the version of history that will be engraved upon the stone and passed down to posterity."
