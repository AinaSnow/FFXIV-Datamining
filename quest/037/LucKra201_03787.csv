1,"TEXT_LUCKRA201_03787_SEQ_01","In the marketplace of Mord Souq, you are greeted by Yalfort, a member of the select few privy to the details surrounding the investigation being carried out in the Empty. After you are joined by Ryne and Urianger, Yalfort informs you that the girl who has been unconscious since leading the attack on Eden has awoken and is being escorted by Thancred to this very location. You learn that her name is Gaia and that she was originally a resident of Eulmore, although she has no memory of recent events. A short while later, she arrives with her newfound footman close behind, and it seems Thancred has been given the unenviable task of carrying her luggage. It soon becomes abundantly clear that she is incredibly impatient, and she demands that if the group insists on speaking at length, they should at least find somewhere to sit down first."
2,"TEXT_LUCKRA201_03787_SEQ_02","Gaia reveals that she has no memory whatsoever of your previous encounter, while Urianger inquires as to the true nature of her arcane abilities. She attributes these powers to a voice inside her head that she refers to as “the faerie,” which bears an uncanny similarity to Ryne's relationship to Minfilia. Gaia comes to the conclusion that if it was the faerie's intention for her to make contact with Eden, that is where she must go, and in so doing find the answers to the questions surrounding her past. In spite of Ryne's and Urianger's warnings, Gaia rushes off into the desert, displaying a surprising turn of speed, prompting Thancred to lead the rest of the group in chasing after her."
3,"TEXT_LUCKRA201_03787_SEQ_03","You race in the direction of a distant scream, where you discover Gaia staring down an enormous vilekin. As you dash to her rescue, she casts a seemingly potent spell, although the dark aura quickly dissipates, leaving the creature entirely unscathed. As it lunges to strike, it is suddenly enveloped in swirling magicks that leave nary a trace of the chitin-plated beast behind, while Gaia herself is thankfully unharmed."
4,"TEXT_LUCKRA201_03787_SEQ_04","Shortly after arriving on the scene, Ryne tells Gaia that if she is determined to risk life and limb to see Eden, you should all travel together. Thancred and Urianger's attempts to talk her out of it are vehemently rebuffed, though her two mentors soon admit that it was merely a ploy to test her resolve. Once again, Gaia cuts the conversation short and leads the way to the Derrick, where your transportation to the Empty awaits."
5,"TEXT_LUCKRA201_03787_SEQ_05","Thancred has finished preparing the skyslipper for the long journey ahead. Although the craft was apparently designed to only seat four people, the addition of the petite Gaia as the fifth member of your group is unlikely to cause any problems. As Thancred suggests, Urianger could always be made to sit with the camping supplies should you be in need of space inside the vessel."
6,"TEXT_LUCKRA201_03787_SEQ_06","After arriving at the camp, you find Gaia gazing towards Eden as it floats silently above the lake. As she stands in quiet contemplation, your comrades prepare to restore the next element to the Empty."

155,"TEXT_LUCKRA201_03787_URIANGER_110_128","The light of thy spirit doth burn bright."
156,"TEXT_LUCKRA201_03787_URIANGER_000_130","Mine apologies, my dear, but we felt it necessary to test thy resolve. Let it suffice it to say thou hast left no room for doubt."
157,"TEXT_LUCKRA201_03787_THANCRED_000_132","For what it's worth, Ryne, I never doubted you. But make no mistake, the danger that Urianger and I spoke of is all too real. If you're prepared to go through with this, we'll be right there beside you."
158,"TEXT_LUCKRA201_03787_RYNE_000_133","That means a lot to me. Thank you."
159,"TEXT_LUCKRA201_03787_GAIA_000_135","I couldn't care less who I travel with, but if we're going to go, then let's get going already. There's supposed to be some sort of craft waiting at the southern watchtower, yes? Come along then, and don't fall behind."
160,"TEXT_LUCKRA201_03787_RYNE_000_140","Of course I'm worried about what may happen when Gaia gets close to Eden. We'll keep a close eye on her, make sure she's all right."
161,"TEXT_LUCKRA201_03787_URIANGER_000_141","Though our circumstance hath changed, our mission most assuredly hath not. Restoring life to the Empty remaineth our primary objective."
162,"TEXT_LUCKRA201_03787_GAIA_000_142","Why couldn't you leave this craft in Mord Souq instead of all the way out here? <sigh> Actually, don't bother explaining. Whatever the reason is, I'm sure it's something frightfully uninteresting. Let's be about it, shall we?"
163,"TEXT_LUCKRA201_03787_THANCRED_000_150","It might be a bit of a tight squeeze with the five of us, but we'll manage. Perhaps Urianger can sit on top of our luggage?"

165,"TEXT_LUCKRA201_03787_RYNE_000_160","Everything seems fine here, as far as I can tell. As for Gaia, she hasn't started attacking anything yet, so I'll take that as a good sign."
166,"TEXT_LUCKRA201_03787_THANCRED_000_161","As usual, we should keep our sojourn here as brief as possible. Let's tend to business quickly."
167,"TEXT_LUCKRA201_03787_URIANGER_000_162","I had hoped that, during our absence, the rebalancing of ambient aether might work further change. Alas, 'twas not to be..."

170,"TEXT_LUCKRA201_03787_GAIA_000_171","The bringer of the Flood, the first sin eater. Would it lead me to my past, or my future?"
