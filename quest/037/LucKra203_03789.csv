1,"TEXT_LUCKRA203_03789_SEQ_01","Following a brief bout of contemplation and postulation, Urianger arrives at the conclusion that in order to complete the cycle of rainfall and evaporation in the Empty, the elements of wind and fire must be restored simultaneously. Naturally, this means that the burden on Ryne and yourself will in effect be doubled, as you attempt to draw forth and meld the two contrasting types of aether. Not to be deterred, you both accept the challenge, though as Thancred points out, the increased strain will require you to be well rested before embarking on your next voyage. Gaia, impatient as always, storms off, while Ryne ponders over what might be troubling her."
2,"TEXT_LUCKRA203_03789_SEQ_02","Despite your best efforts to engage Ryne in conversation, she is reluctant to respond. Perhaps all she needs is someone to /rally her spirits."
3,"TEXT_LUCKRA203_03789_SEQ_03","Ryne explains that she has been worried about Gaia's well-being since before she awakened from her long slumber. Having been raised in isolation, Ryne has precious little experience in speaking with people of a similar age, and she is unsure as to how to approach Gaia. Given what the pair have in common, it seems reasonable to expect that they would be well matched as friends, although Gaia's sullen demeanor makes even approaching her somewhat daunting. Thancred encourages Ryne to take the first step and initiate conversation, while the rest of you silently observe the exchange from just within earshot."
4,"TEXT_LUCKRA203_03789_SEQ_04","Ryne overcomes her initial anxiousness and engages Gaia in some light small talk. Unfortunately, this is met with a less than favorable response, with Gaia expressing her distaste for Ryne's positive outlook before turning on her heels and making her way to Eden's core. Taking this as a cue, Urianger suggests that now would be the opportune moment to commence the next phase of the plan."
5,"TEXT_LUCKRA203_03789_SEQ_05","Urianger has selected Ashfall as the next location, once known for its searing heat and relentless winds. You conjure the images of Ifrit and Garuda while Ryne calls forth the necessary aether to give form to your memories, although some doubt lingers over Ryne's ability to focus on the task at hand. Putting such fears to one side, all that remains is for you to vanquish two raging primals at the same time. What could be simpler?

6,"TEXT_LUCKRA203_03789_SEQ_06","Having survived the combined assault of the reimagined deities of fire and wind, you return triumphant to Eden's core. Ryne is already preparing to pilot Eden back to the camp in order to properly assess the effect that your victory has had on the ambient aether of the Empty."
7,"TEXT_LUCKRA203_03789_SEQ_07","Torrential rain pours down on the vicinity of your camp, though you and your companions are content to stand in the open as it leaves you all drenched through. While Ryne is clearly delighted by the results, Gaia's mood darkens and she launches into a tirade aimed at Eden itself, before clutching her head and making nonsensical utterances. She eventually returns to her senses, but it seems that her inner turmoil has only temporarily subsided."
