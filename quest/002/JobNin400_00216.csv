1,"TEXT_JOBNIN400_00216_SEQ_01","Impressed with your progress, Oboro has decided that your training will continue in the field...as a full-fledged participant in his mission to assassinate Karasu. Having received word that the imperial espionage unit under Karasu's command means to target Captain Grymuwil of the Bloody Executioners, Oboro intends to ascertain the traitor's whereabouts by interrogating one Wolfstan, the captain's trusted lieutenant. Make for Camp Bronze Lake in upper La Noscea, where Oboro will brief you in detail on the plan of attack."

49,"TEXT_JOBNIN400_00216_OBORO_000_001","This much is clear: neither waterfalls nor men of wood will serve to hone your senses further. No, a shinobi of your abilities receives his tutelage in the field. Consider this your first lesson in the art of assassination."
50,"TEXT_JOBNIN400_00216_OBORO_000_002","I need not remind you who our target is. He is ever the elusive bird, and yet I have come across some information that I believe may avail us."
51,"TEXT_JOBNIN400_00216_OBORO_000_003","Rumor has it that Captain Grymuwil of the Bloody Executioners has narrowly evaded several attempts on his life in recent days. This is doubtless the work of Karasu and his men─none other are so bold or skilled as to even consider such an attack."

I recall reading of a famous bath resort not far from here, but the name escapes me... Have you any idea where it might be?"

The issue of the <Emphasis>Harbor Herald</Emphasis> I read earlier spoke of Camp Overlook as a bastion of defense against some unpleasant creatures called kobolds. It sounds like the last place anyone would go for rest and relaxation."

63,"TEXT_JOBNIN400_00216_OBORO_000_050","I had no idea that so many Eorzeans also enjoyed public bathing. I would say it is a comforting sight, but in truth it makes me all the more nostalgic for the pleasures of my homeland."
64,"TEXT_JOBNIN400_00216_OBORO_100_050","That said, seeing all these people milling about gives me cause for concern. Even with these disguises, it is only a matter of time before our foreign mannerisms raise eyebrows among the more observant types."

66,"TEXT_JOBNIN400_00216_OBORO_000_052","The time has come for me to impart to you another technique, which we call <Emphasis>Shukuchi</Emphasis>. You may think of it as compressing the physical space around you, allowing you to cross great distances in the blink of an eye. Go ahead, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, give it a try."
