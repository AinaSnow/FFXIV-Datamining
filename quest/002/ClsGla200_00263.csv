5,"TEXT_CLSGLA200_00263_SEQ_05","Wymond informs you that the ring is worn by members of the Alacran, a notorious criminal organization. Return to the Gladiators' Guild and tell Mylla everything you have learned."

He admits that he is the target of the bounty hunters, and urges the guildmaster to leave the Alacran to him. However, Mylla refuses to heed his counsel and declares that the Gladiators' Guild will confront the bandits at the Silver Bazaar. Make your preparations for the coming battle and rendezvous with Mylla in western Thanalan."
7,"TEXT_CLSGLA200_00263_SEQ_07","After repelling the attackers, you and your comrades are confronted by more members of the Alacran, who are led by a man armed with a blade resembling Aldis's.

8,"TEXT_CLSGLA200_00263_SEQ_08","At the guild, Aldis explains that Leavold, his former Coliseum partner, has taken control of the Alacran and transformed them from a gang of common thieves into the most feared criminal organization in Thanalan. However, Mylla insists that the Leavold she once knew would never do such terrible things. As you witness the exchange between the two of them, you cannot help but wonder what terrible twist of fate tore the three friends apart seven long years ago.

※The next gladiator quest will be available from Mylla upon reaching level 25."
