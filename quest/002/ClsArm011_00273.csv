55,"TEXT_CLSARM011_00273_HNAANZA_000_12","I take it G'wahnako has explained to you the history and nature of our craft? Good. I have little to add on that front, save this: the life of an armorer is not an easy one."
56,"TEXT_CLSARM011_00273_HNAANZA_000_13","Day after day, you will pit flesh and blood against iron and flame. And without a passion for the forge, you will fail. But passion alone will not make an armorer of you."
57,"TEXT_CLSARM011_00273_HNAANZA_000_14","To truly master this craft, you must be possessed of a will as unyielding as the metals you work. Knowing what lies before you, have you the fortitude to persevere?"

64,"TEXT_CLSARM011_00273_HNAANZA_000_27","But if you ever give me aught less than your best, you will be out the door before you realize my boot has connected with your backside. Are we clear on that?"
