50,"TEXT_CLSHRV100_00208_FUFUCHA_000_3","But let us see about your first task... Ah, yes. To help you grasp the basics of botany, I would like you to gather ten pots' worth of latex."
51,"TEXT_CLSHRV100_00208_FUFUCHA_000_4","The forest yields to us many and more resources. It is the botanist's job to know what can be found, and where."
52,"TEXT_CLSHRV100_00208_FUFUCHA_000_5","If it is latex you require, you would do well to search just outside the Blue Badger Gate or the Yellow Serpent Gate."

58,"TEXT_CLSHRV100_00208_FUFUCHA_000_11","Ah, yes. Precisely ten pots of latex, just as I instructed. You have done well."
59,"TEXT_CLSHRV100_00208_FUFUCHA_000_12","Latex is easy to find and equally easy to harvest. As such, collecting the stuff is an ideal task for young botanists who are learning their way around a hatchet."
