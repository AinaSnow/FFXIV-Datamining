It would seem Yayake's name has been mentioned in connection with that of her former guildmaster, Mumuepo, whom the Blades believe to have fomented unrest in Ul'dah. The disgraced thaumaturge is currently remanded in the Coliseum, where he is forced to fight until his debt to society is repaid. Recalling the way Yayake once idolized the man, Cocobuki is eager to investigate the prelate's recent activities, and asks for your assistance.

But what could he be plotting? In desperation, Cocobuki decides to set a trap for Yayake in a bid to make her talk. He would have you conceal yourself before the rear entrance to the Coliseum, and ambush the parlous prelate as she steals away to meet her conspirator-in-chief."
