0,"TEXT_CLSARM151_00277_SEQ_00","Forgemaster H'naanza wishes you to offer a sympathetic ear to a novice armorer."
1,"TEXT_CLSARM151_00277_SEQ_01","H'naanza is concerned about one of her more diligent novices who is uncharacteristically late with an order. Speak with Dyrstwyda at the Armorers' Guild and learn what has caused the delay."
2,"TEXT_CLSARM151_00277_SEQ_02","It seems that after being subjected to some withering criticism from Blanstyr, a veteran armorer, Dyrstwyda has lost confidence in her ability. Speak with Blanstyr at the Armorers' Guild and discover what prompted his scathing remark."
3,"TEXT_CLSARM151_00277_SEQ_03","Before Blanstyr will discuss what prompted him to criticize Dyrstwyda, he demands that you prove your ability as an armorer. Synthesize a decorated bronze barbut and a bronze buckler and deliver them to the veteran artisan."
4,"TEXT_CLSARM151_00277_SEQ_04","You have delivered the requested pieces to Blanstyr, and thereby earned his grudging respect. Rather than explain his criticism of Dyrstwyda's work, he instead insists that you tell the crestfallen novice to learn to examine her own flaws or turn her back on the forge for good. Return to Dyrstwyda with Blanstyr's “advice.”"
5,"TEXT_CLSARM151_00277_SEQ_05","After hearing Blanstyr's advice, Dyrstwyda seems even more inclined to abandon her dream of becoming a master armorer. Perhaps it wasn't such a good idea to recount his words so faithfully... Return to Forgemaster H'naanza and apprise her of the situation."
6,"TEXT_CLSARM151_00277_SEQ_06","H'naanza reveals that she and Blanstyr were once apprenticed to the same master, but that an irreconcilable difference of opinion has kept the two armorers at odds for many years. Loath to allow their old rivalry to undermine the unity of the guild, H'naanza pledges to think upon what can be done to resolve the matter once and for all. Continue to hone your skills as an armorer that you might provide support to the forgemaster when the time comes.

※The next armorer quest will be available from H'naanza upon reaching level 20."

50,"TEXT_CLSARM151_00277_HNAANZA_000_3","I was due a barbut and a buckler from her a few bells ago, but I find myself standing here with nary a noseguard."

52,"TEXT_CLSARM151_00277_HNAANZA_000_5","Something must be amiss, and I need to find out what. I'd go and ask her myself, but I fear my usual approach would do more harm than good. The lass might be built like a stack of anvils, but she flinches at the merest hint of criticism..."

58,"TEXT_CLSARM151_00277_DYRSTWYDA_000_14","After but a single glance at the armor I had made, he y-yelled that my work wasn't fit to “cover a kobold's arse.”"

65,"TEXT_CLSARM151_00277_BLANSTYR_000_22","All these whelps trainin' under H'naanza get their heads filled with daft bloody notions o' cooperation an' camaraderie when what they should be learnin' is how to use a pair o' pliers."

Well...thank you for passing on Blanstyr's...<Emphasis>advice</Emphasis>."

72,"TEXT_CLSARM151_00277_DYRSTWYDA_000_42","If such strength is required to master the armorer's art, then mayhap I have mistaken my calling."

78,"TEXT_CLSARM151_00277_HNAANZA_000_53","We always had our differences, but when our master retired, they became that much more stark. And when we both put ourselves forward for the role of forgemaster, the resulting contest drove a permanent wedge between us."
79,"TEXT_CLSARM151_00277_HNAANZA_000_54","Blanstyr's arguments are not entirely without merit, but neither is his approach the only way to train new armorers."
80,"TEXT_CLSARM151_00277_HNAANZA_000_55","For that damnable curmudgeon, though, it's his way or no way at all. The idea of nurturing aught less than gods-given talent is anathema to him, and his ears wax deaf at the mere mention of it. But outfitting an army is the work of more than a talented few─it is the work of <Emphasis>many</Emphasis> hands acting in unison."
81,"TEXT_CLSARM151_00277_HNAANZA_000_56","I have turned a blind eye to Blanstyr's behavior until now, but if he would threaten the unity of this guild, something must needs be done. I will think on it."
82,"TEXT_CLSARM151_00277_BLANSTYR_000_30","Bring me a decorated bronze barbut and a bronze buckler or ye'll get naught outta me save curses, ye weepin' sack o' Sahagin shite."

84,"TEXT_CLSARM151_00277_BLANSTYR_000_32","...Bugger me. Are you <Emphasis>sure</Emphasis> ye made these yerself?"
85,"TEXT_CLSARM151_00277_BLANSTYR_000_33","Huh! Seems at least <Emphasis>one</Emphasis> o' H'naanza's whelps knows the difference 'twixt hammer an' sledge. Builder take me, ye've some talent, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>."
86,"TEXT_CLSARM151_00277_BLANSTYR_000_34","This barbut well shows the character o' yer work: precise an' uncompromisin', as it should be."
87,"TEXT_CLSARM151_00277_BLANSTYR_000_35","Ye've realized that forgin' a helm ain't a matter o' slappin' a few molded sheets o' bronze together. Nice."
88,"TEXT_CLSARM151_00277_BLANSTYR_000_36","An' yer buckler's just as good. Small an' light, but a damn sight sturdier than shields twice the size."
89,"TEXT_CLSARM151_00277_BLANSTYR_000_37","Didn't expect to be sayin' this, but I'm impressed. With this level o' quality an' polish, ye could make a tidy livin' for yerself as an artisan."
90,"TEXT_CLSARM151_00277_BLANSTYR_000_38","But yer the exception as proves the rule, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>. Fact is, the other novices ain't fit to lick yer boots─Dyrstwyda included. So you tell her this from me..."
91,"TEXT_CLSARM151_00277_BLANSTYR_000_39","If ye've the time to wallow in wounded tears, ye've the time to examine yer own mistakes.
