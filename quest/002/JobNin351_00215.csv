Wielding your newfound talents to the best of your ability, you and Oboro manage to stand your ground against this formidable foe, who departs the scene with a swift stealthiness reminiscent of his namesake. Take a deep breath, calm your mind, and speak with Oboro to hear his thoughts on these events."

At the same time, he reaffirms his belief that you will prove a valuable ally to the two Domans in their mission of vengeance, and encourages you to continue to hone your skills.
