Karasu claims that the measures he has taken are for your own benefit, as he would see you truly consummate your training before you inherit the garb of the shinobi. To this end, he has entrusted the various pieces to four of his “shadows” that he has deemed expendable. You are to traverse the land and defeat each in single combat to earn what you would claim as yours. Your first challenge awaits at the Red Rooster Stead."
