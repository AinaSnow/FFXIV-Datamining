1,"TEXT_CLSCUL201_00259_SEQ_01","One of your guildmates, a woman named Diving Dove, has been looking strangely tense of late, but is too engrossed in her work to take the time to relax. Concerned for her well-being, Lyngsath bids you prepare her some dried plums, in the hope that they might help to lighten her burden. The pixie plums required to make them can be obtained in the wilderness, or purchased via the market board in Hawkers' Alley."
2,"TEXT_CLSCUL201_00259_SEQ_02","Pretending to seek her opinion on your handiwork, you succeed in convincing Diving Dove to eat your dried plums. She soon sees through your ruse, however, and takes umbrage at Lyngsath's interference. Thankfully, her mortification swiftly passes, and she admits to feeling moved by your gift, before promising to take better care of herself in future.

※The next culinarian quest will be available from Lyngsath upon reaching level 25."
