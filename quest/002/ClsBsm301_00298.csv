0,"TEXT_CLSBSM301_00298_SEQ_00","Forgemaster Brithael is eyeing you with an ominous grin on his face. It may be wise to inquire as to why."
1,"TEXT_CLSBSM301_00298_SEQ_01","Apparently, your recent accomplishments have not gone unnoticed. According to Brithael, a wealthy Ul'dahn has requested you by name for a prestigious commission. Speak with Faezahr for more information."
2,"TEXT_CLSBSM301_00298_SEQ_02","Although the commission represents a chance to win respect and renown, Faezahr warns you that failure is not an option. He then directs you to meet with the client's representative, a woman named Khuswyb. Summon your courage and address her directly."
3,"TEXT_CLSBSM301_00298_SEQ_03","Khuswyb's master wishes to present his chief groundsman with a plumed iron hatchet in recognition of his loyal service. Needless to say, your client will settle for nothing short of perfection. Craft a plumed iron hatchet of unsurpassed quality and present it to Khuswyb."
4,"TEXT_CLSBSM301_00298_SEQ_04","Your masterpiece has a profound impact on Khuswyb, and she accepts it with great fanfare. Relay the good news to Faezahr."
5,"TEXT_CLSBSM301_00298_SEQ_05","Faezahr seems unsurprised by your success, though he is quick to note Khuswyb's enthusiastic endorsement. The trader then begrudgingly bids you bear word of your success to the forgemaster─though not before once again expressing his low opinion of the man. Return to Brithael and report all that has transpired."
6,"TEXT_CLSBSM301_00298_SEQ_06","Brushing aside Faezahr's comments, Brithael reminisces about the day you first joined the Blacksmiths' Guild, claiming that he always knew you had the potential for greatness. He then swears that as long as you remain loyal to the guild, you will be able to count on its unwavering support.

※The next blacksmith quest will be available from Brithael upon reaching level 35."

54,"TEXT_CLSBSM301_00298_BRITHAEL_000_7","Anyway, ye'll do it, won't ye? Bah! 'Course ye bloody will! Ye'd be a godsdamned fool to refuse!"

77,"TEXT_CLSBSM301_00298_KHUSWYB_000_31","Do you have the hatchet?"
78,"TEXT_CLSBSM301_00298_KHUSWYB_000_32","My... Though I count myself no expert in such matters, even I am sensible to this hatchet's quality. It is...magnificent."
79,"TEXT_CLSBSM301_00298_KHUSWYB_000_33","Master Faezahr's words did not do you justice. You are a veritable prodigy, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>madam<Else/>sir</If>."
80,"TEXT_CLSBSM301_00298_KHUSWYB_000_34","Your hatchet is more a work of art than a tool. When I run my fingers along its smooth leather grip and gaze upon its flawless, sparkling blade, I find that I am...<Emphasis>moved</Emphasis>."
81,"TEXT_CLSBSM301_00298_KHUSWYB_000_35","It seems a great shame to allow such a masterpiece to be used for mere gardening."
82,"TEXT_CLSBSM301_00298_KHUSWYB_000_36","But...tools are made for a purpose. Mayhap, as the blade dulls and the grip wears, it will gain a different sort of beauty..."
83,"TEXT_CLSBSM301_00298_KHUSWYB_000_37","Ah, but I am beginning to sound like our chief groundsman. Such a gentle soul... I am quite sure that he will see the artistry in your creation. Why, it may even serve to inspire him in his own craft. You should be proud."
84,"TEXT_CLSBSM301_00298_KHUSWYB_000_38","On behalf of my lord, I thank you, <Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>. Pray give my regards to Master Faezahr."
