2,"TEXT_SUBWIL035_00227_SEQ_02","You have collected the coblyn grease Fafafono requested. Deliver it to Adelard at the Hammers."
3,"TEXT_SUBWIL035_00227_SEQ_03","Adelard is happy to receive the coblyn grease, and is thankful to you and Fafafono for acquiring it. He explains that the hammers are creating a foundation on which estates for Ul'dahns of considerable means are to be built. Of course, not everybody is excited at this proposition, such as the Silver Bazaar's own Kikipu. It would seem that not everybody's idea of progress is the same."

50,"TEXT_SUBWIL035_00227_FAFAFONO_003","I'm surrounded by fools here. They detest the hammers and the new way of life they symbolize. They care only for the successes of the past, but it blinds them to the opportunities of the present. Change isn't coming, friend─it's already here!"
