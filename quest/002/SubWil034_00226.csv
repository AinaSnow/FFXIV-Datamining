1,"TEXT_SUBWIL034_00226_SEQ_01","Four laborers who tend the derricks are taking an elongated break in the Silver Bazaar, and testing Kikipu's last nerve in the process. Chase them out of the Bazaar by casting /doubt on the validity of their actions, the purpose of their presence, and the very nature of their existence."
2,"TEXT_SUBWIL034_00226_SEQ_02","You have rid the Silver Bazaar of the surly derrick workers. Run and tell Kikipu of your feat."
