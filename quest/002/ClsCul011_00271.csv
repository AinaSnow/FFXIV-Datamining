50,"TEXT_CLSCUL011_00271_CHARLYS_000_2","This will come as no surprise, but he is the finest chef in Limsa Lominsa. His skill and dedication are second to none."
51,"TEXT_CLSCUL011_00271_CHARLYS_000_3","You will find the guildmaster up the stairs yonder, keeping a watchful eye on his charges. Impress upon him your desire to learn, and he will surely find a place for you in his stew─by which I mean the guild."
52,"TEXT_CLSCUL011_00271_CHARLYS_000_5","Still unsure? Then I think it best that you do not go before the guildmaster."
53,"TEXT_CLSCUL011_00271_CHARLYS_000_6","As I believe I mentioned, he is passionate about cookery, and has little patience for those who show anything less than absolute commitment to the craft. Such ingredients spoil the stew, you see...and he is <Emphasis>fiercely</Emphasis> protective of his stew."
54,"TEXT_CLSCUL011_00271_LYNGSATH_000_11","Well met, 'venturer. I take it ye want to join our guild. Let's 'ave a good look at ye, then."
55,"TEXT_CLSCUL011_00271_LYNGSATH_000_12","...Bah! What's an underfed whelp like you know about cookin'? Judgin' by them scrawny arms o' yours, ye'd struggle to lift a spoon, never mind a skillet!"
56,"TEXT_CLSCUL011_00271_LYNGSATH_000_13","...Hahaha! I jest, I jest... <sigh> It don't take muscle to be a culinarian. 'Ells, it don't even take talent─'least not on its own."
57,"TEXT_CLSCUL011_00271_LYNGSATH_000_14","No, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>son</If>, more'n anythin' else, becomin' a good cook boils down to <Emphasis>passion</Emphasis>. If ye got that, there ain't nothin' ye can't achieve. So tell me...'ave ye got it?"

62,"TEXT_CLSCUL011_00271_LYNGSATH_000_21","That's the spirit! Aye, yer passion fer the culinary arts is plain to see."

64,"TEXT_CLSCUL011_00271_LYNGSATH_000_23","Make no mistake, our trade's as tough as old mutton, an' passion's the only thing what gets us through the gristly bits. But enough talk─what do ye call yerself?"
65,"TEXT_CLSCUL011_00271_LYNGSATH_000_24","Well then, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, welcome to the guild. To mark the occasion, I present ye with yer very own skillet."
66,"TEXT_CLSCUL011_00271_LYNGSATH_000_25","Ain't much to look at, but it'll more'n serve a novice like yerself."
