1,"TEXT_CLSGLA050_00256_SEQ_01","A gladiator must be capable of commanding an opponent's attention at will. To help you better understand this concept, Mylla has bid you seek out Lominsan marauders harassing people outside the Quicksand. Once located, tell them to face /me and show them that their disruptive behavior will not be tolerated."
2,"TEXT_CLSGLA050_00256_SEQ_02","The mere sight of you sends the marauders packing. Enter the Quicksand and deal with any belligerents that remain."

5,"TEXT_CLSGLA050_00256_SEQ_05","Mylla informs you that the Lominsan marauders have begun terrorizing merchants outside Scorpion Crossing in western Thanalan. Speak with any victim you can find so that you may track down Pfarmurl's gang and bring them to justice."
6,"TEXT_CLSGLA050_00256_SEQ_06","The Bloody Marauders may be the ones behind a recent assault on a traveling merchant. Search for the merchant's goods outside Scorpion Crossing and confront the Lominsans if they are still in the area."
7,"TEXT_CLSGLA050_00256_SEQ_07","You recover the merchant's goods and ensure that the Bloody Marauders will terrorize the people of Thanalan no more. Return the stolen goods to their rightful owner."
8,"TEXT_CLSGLA050_00256_SEQ_08","The merchant is overjoyed to receive his stolen merchandise. Return to the guild and report to Mylla."
9,"TEXT_CLSGLA050_00256_SEQ_09","Mylla is pleased to hear of your accomplishments. She reminds you that by mastering the sword, you master yourself. Duly advised, you return to your training.
