1,"TEXT_JOBNIN401_00217_SEQ_01","Oboro would first take up position high on the rooftops, out of sight. He explains that while a shinobi can cover great distances with Shukuchi, the technique only works effectively on level ground. Tsubame has taken up position at an ideal starting point. Follow her lead to reach the rooftop where Oboro awaits, and keep lookout with your fellow shinobi for Wolfstan's arrival."
2,"TEXT_JOBNIN401_00217_SEQ_02","A man Oboro quickly identifies as Wolfstan has arrived in Camp Bronze Lake.

Descend from the rooftops and rendezvous in secret with the kunoichi."

6,"TEXT_JOBNIN401_00217_SEQ_06","You successfully make your way past Karasu's defenses, but your assassination attempt ends with a familiar result─your ever-evasive prey slipping through your fingers. Tasting his most bitter defeat yet, however, has left Oboro more resolute than ever. Regroup at the dock storehouse and inquire as to your next course of action."
7,"TEXT_JOBNIN401_00217_SEQ_07","Though frustrated at this latest failure, Oboro is convinced that with your growing skills, it will not be long before the three of you can stand against Karasu in earnest. You resolve to take your experiences to heart and train as you have never trained before.

※The next ninja quest will be available from Oboro upon reaching level 45."
