Make no mistake, I mean to shape you into an artisan, however hard I have to pound."
50,"TEXT_CLSARM021_00274_HNAANZA_000_3","Save your sweat for the forge, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>─I don't expect you to fashion full suits of plate on your first day. Just pay close attention to my instructions, be diligent in your work, and the skill will come in due time."
51,"TEXT_CLSARM021_00274_HNAANZA_000_4","Now let's be about your first lesson, shall we?"
52,"TEXT_CLSARM021_00274_HNAANZA_000_5","I want you to take up your hammer and make me a bronze ingot. A mundane task, I grant you, but one which every armorer must master."

54,"TEXT_CLSARM021_00274_HNAANZA_000_7","'Tis not the strongest of alloys, of course, but it is that very quality that makes bronze so easy to shape─and the metal of choice for a novice armorer."
55,"TEXT_CLSARM021_00274_HNAANZA_000_8","To forge your ingot, you'll need to procure two chunks of copper ore, a chunk of tin ore, and an ice shard."

62,"TEXT_CLSARM021_00274_HNAANZA_000_23","Hm. So this is the sort of quality I can expect from you, is it? For a novice armorer, this is excellent work. Excellent. Well done, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."
63,"TEXT_CLSARM021_00274_HNAANZA_000_24","The key to making good bronze is judging the ratio of copper to tin. With too much tin, the alloy becomes harder but also more brittle. Not the sort of material you want protecting your vital organs."
64,"TEXT_CLSARM021_00274_HNAANZA_000_25","Lest you forget, quality is a matter of life and death in our craft. That is why we teach our initiates the ideal metallurgic composition of every item we forge. Not that all are quick to learn. There are some who seem destined to produce mediocre results however painstakingly the processes are explained."
65,"TEXT_CLSARM021_00274_HNAANZA_000_26","Thank the Builder you are not one of them. I am pleased to say that your ingot would fetch a decent price in the markets."
66,"TEXT_CLSARM021_00274_HNAANZA_000_27","But do not let this first success make you complacent. A single bad helm will lose you more trust than a hundred good ones will win, because bad armor means dead men. It is not enough that your work be good. It must needs be <Emphasis>consistently</Emphasis> good."
67,"TEXT_CLSARM021_00274_HNAANZA_000_28","And achieving that consistency requires discipline and long hours of crafting the same item over and over, again and again. For you, this means a mountain of bronze ingots. Bronze ingots in your dreams. Bronze ingots until the process is so ingrained that you wake up and find that your pillow is an ingot you made in your sleep."
68,"TEXT_CLSARM021_00274_HNAANZA_000_29","When you feel you have learned all you can from forging bronze ingots, seek me out and I will find you something else to craft. May the Builder guide your hand, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."
