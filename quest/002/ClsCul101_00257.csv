2,"TEXT_CLSCUL101_00257_SEQ_02","Somewhat predictably, your immaculately prepared gift of grilled dodo serves to humiliate Ingham once again. By way of repayment for your unwelcome act of kindness, he dutifully proceeds to share his knowledge of tradecraft leves with you. It would seem these tasks, assigned by T'mokkri of the Adventurers' Guild, offer an excellent opportunity to gain cooking experience while earning coin.

※The next culinarian quest will be available from Lyngsath upon reaching level 15."
