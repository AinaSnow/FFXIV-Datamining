1,"TEXT_JOBREL007_00206_SEQ_01","According to Jalzahn, your relic weapon is presently not benefiting fully from the soul energy it holds. The problem, he posits, lies in the unattuned state of that energy to its host. Having struck a wall in his search for a solution, Jalzahn bids you recruit the assistance of the ill-tempered weaponsmith Gerolt."

3,"TEXT_JOBREL007_00206_SEQ_03","In an unlikely alliance, Jalzahn and Gerolt have devised the means by which your weapon may be further enhanced. It seems that, by rendering the relic aethertight by way of a special glaze, you will be able to attune its soul energy through normal use. Speak with Jalzahn when you are ready to begin the process."

78,"TEXT_JOBREL007_00206_GEROLT_000_076","Ye see, soul energy naturally becomes attuned to its host through use. Problem is, bein' composed of aether, that energy's fickle as sin─gets easily distracted by forces outside the host."

83,"TEXT_JOBREL007_00206_GEROLT_000_081","Ye know them Archons from Sharlayan? They use newfangled goggles what allow the wearer to see traces of aether. We can make somethin' similar, I reckon."
84,"TEXT_JOBREL007_00206_GEROLT_000_082","Mind ye, we don't need nothin' near as sophisticated. A magnifyin' glass fitted with lenses what're crafted from aether-sensitive material ought to serve our needs."
