He has also suggested a number of ways to acquire materials, such as mining and hunting. Craft three bronze cross-pein hammers and present them to the forgemaster."
2,"TEXT_CLSBSM051_00293_SEQ_02","Your hammers have met with Brithael's approval, and he rewards your efforts with an amateur's file, which should prove most useful in the days to come. He urges you to familiarize yourself with the tool, and return once you have gained more experience.

※The next blacksmith quest will be available from Brithael upon reaching level 10."
