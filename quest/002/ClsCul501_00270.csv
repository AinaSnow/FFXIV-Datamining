5,"TEXT_CLSCUL501_00270_SEQ_05","After some deliberation, it has been decided that you will prepare all four dishes for the sultana.

Speak with Zanthael at Bulwark Hall to gain admittance."
6,"TEXT_CLSCUL501_00270_SEQ_06","Much to your relief, the sultana is tremendously satisfied with her meal, and Lord Lolorito's plot to humiliate you and the Bismarck is foiled. For the second time, you have gotten the better of the Chefsbane. Deliver the glad tidings to Lyngsath."
