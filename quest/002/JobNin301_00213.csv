1,"TEXT_JOBNIN301_00213_SEQ_01","Sensing that the soul of his ancestors is strong in you, Oboro willingly imparts to you a basic form of ninjutsu, the Fuma Shuriken. Form the mudra for heaven, or Ten, then unleash the technique and channel the energy forth as a flaming projectile. As your first task, demonstrate the technique for Oboro on the mokujin, or training dummy, that has been set up outside the dock storehouse."
2,"TEXT_JOBNIN301_00213_SEQ_02","Your Fuma Shuriken strikes the mokujin true. Speak with Oboro to hear his evaluation of your technique."

4,"TEXT_JOBNIN301_00213_SEQ_04","By holding your own against Oboro and his summoned minions, you have passed your latest test with flying colors. Speak with Oboro, who is doubtless pleased with your efforts."
5,"TEXT_JOBNIN301_00213_SEQ_05","Oboro and Tsubame are most impressed at the swiftness with which you have mastered your first mudra. In return for the lesson you received, you instruct the Domans in the finer points of the Eorzean bow, a gesture that─despite its seeming simplicity─does not come easily to Oboro. He encourages you to continue to hone your technique until you are ready to receive your next lesson.

※The next ninja quest will be available from Tsubame upon reaching level 35."

50,"TEXT_JOBNIN301_00213_OBORO_000_002","Heed my words well, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. For the shinobi, blade and mind are one. The weak mind gives rise to a weak blade. The false mind gives rise to a false blade. But the mind that is strong and true? That blade will know no equal."
51,"TEXT_JOBNIN301_00213_OBORO_000_003","Such were the teachings of my master, his master, and his master's master before him. The shinobi must keep presence of mind at all times, or his blade may as well be one of grass."
52,"TEXT_JOBNIN301_00213_OBORO_000_004","That is the lesson of the mind. Now we shall begin the lesson of the body."
53,"TEXT_JOBNIN301_00213_OBORO_000_005","You will recall that the art of ninjutsu involves using hand gestures called mudra to summon the energies of heaven, earth, and man─<Emphasis>Ten</Emphasis>, <Emphasis>Chi</Emphasis>, and <Emphasis>Jin</Emphasis> in the Doman tongue."
54,"TEXT_JOBNIN301_00213_OBORO_000_006","Myriad techniques can be unleashed depending on the mudra you combine, and the order in which you do so... But perhaps I am getting ahead of myself. A child must learn to walk before he can run."
55,"TEXT_JOBNIN301_00213_OBORO_000_007","To begin, I would see you master your first mudra─Ten, the mudra of heaven. Summon the energy of heaven and project it forth, and from your hand will fly a flaming star, or Fuma Shuriken."
56,"TEXT_JOBNIN301_00213_OBORO_000_008","Outside of the storehouse, you will find a <Emphasis>mokujin</Emphasis>─a wooden man of the sort traditionally used in Doma for training. Do as I have told you and strike it with a Fuma Shuriken. I will observe your technique from a distance."
