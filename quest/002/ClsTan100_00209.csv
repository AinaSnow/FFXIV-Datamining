2,"TEXT_CLSTAN100_00209_SEQ_02","Geva sees potential in you, despite your painfully amateurish technique. Potential is nothing without commitment, however. If you harbor hopes of producing work worthy of the Fen–Yll name, you must continue to apply yourself. Though the burden of expectation is heavy, you resolve to spare no effort in your attempt to master the craft of leatherworking.
