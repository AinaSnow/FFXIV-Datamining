1,"TEXT_CLSBSM021_00292_SEQ_01","As a firm believer in hands-on education, Brithael has instructed you to smelt bronze, an alloy of tin and copper. The requisite ore can be purchased from Smydhaemr, the guild supplier, but the essential fire shard will have to be obtained elsewhere. Craft a single bronze ingot and deliver it to Brithael."
2,"TEXT_CLSBSM021_00292_SEQ_02","Brithael is reasonably impressed by the quality of your bronze and declares that you have a gift for the craft. However, he stresses that no amount of talent can make up for a lack of experience, and asks that you return for further training only after the fundamentals have become second nature to you.

※The next blacksmith quest will be available from Brithael upon reaching level 5."
