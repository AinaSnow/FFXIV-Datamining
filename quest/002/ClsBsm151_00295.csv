0,"TEXT_CLSBSM151_00295_SEQ_00","Forgemaster Brithael seems upset. Perhaps there is something you can do to help."
1,"TEXT_CLSBSM151_00295_SEQ_01","Forgemaster Brithael has no interest in matters of coin, but has nevertheless been ordered by Forgemaster H'naanza of the Armorers' Guild to find a way to increase exports to Gridania. This requires him to work closely with a trader named Faezahr, whom he seems loath to meet. Speak with the merchant outside the guild on the forgemaster's behalf."
2,"TEXT_CLSBSM151_00295_SEQ_02","Faezahr wastes no time explaining how best to approach the Gridanians. However, before he will agree to negotiate on the guild's behalf, he requires samples of merchandise to present to potential buyers. Craft a bronze spatha and a spiked bronze labrys for the seasoned trader."
3,"TEXT_CLSBSM151_00295_SEQ_03","Having initially dismissed you as a mere errand <If(PlayerParameter(4))>girl<Else/>boy</If>, Faezahr is impressed by the quality of your craftsmanship, and readily agrees to present the weapons you made to his Gridanian contacts. 

※The next blacksmith quest will be available from Brithael upon reaching level 20."

I'll work with you, smith, and I'll even keep my diction simple. Taking instruction from that drunkard will have dulled your wits. Now listen."
