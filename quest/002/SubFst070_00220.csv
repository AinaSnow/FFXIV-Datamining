49,"TEXT_SUBFST070_00220_GONTRANT_000_2","Guildleves are the means by which we document requests for assistance from the citizenry, prior to assigning them to adventurers possessed of the necessary skills."
50,"TEXT_SUBFST070_00220_GONTRANT_000_3","From “battlecraft leves” that require the extermination of monsters, to “tradecraft leves” that ask for the creation of goods, the tasks we term “levequests” are many and varied in their nature."
51,"TEXT_SUBFST070_00220_GONTRANT_000_4","Should your interest be piqued, I suggest you make your way to Bentbranch Meadows and speak with Tierney. She will be happy to set your feet on the path to completing your first levequest."

63,"TEXT_SUBFST070_00220_TIERNEY_000_24","If you wish to know more, pray speak with Battlewarden Ribald in yonder tent. I will inform him of your success against the anoles so that there are no doubts as to your abilities."
