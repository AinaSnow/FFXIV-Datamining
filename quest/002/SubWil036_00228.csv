1,"TEXT_SUBWIL036_00228_SEQ_01","Danyell believes that his fisherman father has been stuck on land of late because his compass is broken. Venture outside the Silver Bazaar and see if you can find three chunks of magnetite to fix the broken instrument."
2,"TEXT_SUBWIL036_00228_SEQ_02","You have collected three chunks of magnetite. Deliver them to Galfridus at the Silver Bazaar."
3,"TEXT_SUBWIL036_00228_SEQ_03","The magnetite you supplied can be used to mend the damaged compass. Tragically, however, there does not seem to be much use for it once repaired."
