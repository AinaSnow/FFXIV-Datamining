3,"TEXT_CLSCUL351_00267_SEQ_03","Lavishing your ratatouille with praise, Latisha goes on to tell you of her responsibilities as the Bismarck's bookkeeper. As is the case with most other professions, it appears that speed is of the essence if one wishes to maintain a well-run restaurant.

※The next culinarian quest will be available from Lyngsath upon reaching level 40."

59,"TEXT_CLSCUL351_00267_LATISHA_000_023","In fact, you have just witnessed one of my more important duties: keeping track of our members' progress. I've found that sampling each person's rendition of ratatouille gives a marvelous insight into their growth."
60,"TEXT_CLSCUL351_00267_LATISHA_000_024","Owing to its simplicity, the vegetable sauté lends itself well to variation, allowing the chef to pour himself into its creation. Indeed, your own bespeaks your ability to create a quality dish under strict time constraints."
61,"TEXT_CLSCUL351_00267_LATISHA_000_025","Do not underestimate that skill. You'll find a great deal of a restaurant's success lies in performing tasks expeditiously. As an example, some other services I provide are procuring ingredients, ensuring our equipment functions, and, perhaps most importantly, listening to our customers."
62,"TEXT_CLSCUL351_00267_LATISHA_000_026","If any of these tasks were ignored for an extended period, it is fair to say the Bismarck would fall into chaos, and our name would lose its considerable luster."
