According to Godriquelain, however, the members of this traveling troupe are in fact fiends in disguise. He asks that you answer the troupe's call for volunteers, that you may get close to its members and determine whether they pose a threat. If you would oblige him, speak with the uncanny illusionist at Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre, and offer her your services.
