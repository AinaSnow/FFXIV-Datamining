67,"TEXT_MANWIL001_00594_MOMODI_000_37","Like our conflict with the Amalj'aa, for example. They've been plaguin' the sultanate for nigh on, oooh...<Emphasis>forever</Emphasis> now."

74,"TEXT_MANWIL001_00594_MOMODI_000_44","There is one thing the survivors agree on, though: the part played by a band of adventurers who laid down their lives for a realm that wasn't their own."
75,"TEXT_MANWIL001_00594_MOMODI_000_45","They fought valiantly, and like so many others, they never returned. Deeds worth rememberin', I'm sure you'll agree. It's just a shame our recollections of those brave heroes are as jumbled as those of the Calamity itself."

77,"TEXT_MANWIL001_00594_MOMODI_000_47","But even if we can't remember them, we'll not let 'em be forgotten, and so we call 'em the Warriors of Light."
