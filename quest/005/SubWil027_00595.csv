49,"TEXT_SUBWIL027_00595_MOMODI_000_2","If so, mayhap it's time you ventured beyond the city walls. The bustlin' streets of Ul'dah are one thing, but the wilds of Thanalan─that's another altogether."
50,"TEXT_SUBWIL027_00595_MOMODI_000_3","I know a bloke you might fancy speakin' to, and he you. Name of Papashan. You'll find him over at the Ul'dah Dispatch Yard. No doubt he'll have some work for you."
51,"TEXT_SUBWIL027_00595_MOMODI_000_4","The Dispatch Yard's over in central Thanalan. Just head out the door across the hall and you'll see the Gate of Nald staring right back at you. Pass through it and head east. You'll come upon it 'fore long."
52,"TEXT_SUBWIL027_00595_MOMODI_000_5","There's dangers beyond the wall, though. More than I'd care to count. Nothin' too terrible, mind you, but feisty enough to attack if you draw near. Don't say nobody cared enough to warn you."

55,"TEXT_SUBWIL027_00595_PAPASHAN_000_12","An empty title, I assure you. I truly am no more than a tired old Lalafell passing his final years in quiet and solitude."

59,"TEXT_SUBWIL027_00595_PAPASHAN_000_16","But there is still much work to be done. The wounds left by the Calamity run deep. Isolated areas beyond our lines of supply remain, and there are places yet wanting for relief and restoration."
60,"TEXT_SUBWIL027_00595_PAPASHAN_000_17","Ul'dah needs the aid of you and your brethren, friend. In fact, never has our need been <Emphasis>more</Emphasis> dire."
