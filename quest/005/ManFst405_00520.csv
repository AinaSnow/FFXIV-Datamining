2,"TEXT_MANFST405_00520_SEQ_02","Within the echoing halls of the Waking Sands, you are reunited first with Yda and later Y'shtola, to the surprise and delight of all concerned. The pair reveal that they have spent the days since the raid searching for information on the location of the Scions taken prisoner by the Empire. What is more, Y'shtola's latest inquiries have borne fruit: your comrades are being held at Castrum Centri, an imperial stronghold in Mor Dhona.
