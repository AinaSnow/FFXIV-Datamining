0,"TEXT_CLSWDK008_00537_SEQ_00","Timbermaster Beatin is staring at you quite intently."
1,"TEXT_CLSWDK008_00537_SEQ_01","Gairhard has once again named you as his carpenter of choice and requested that you craft an oak composite bow. Beatin speculates that the bow is for Gairhard himself, and will therefore settle for nothing less than absolute perfection. Craft a quality oak composite bow and present it to the timbermaster."
2,"TEXT_CLSWDK008_00537_SEQ_02","Despite his best efforts, Beatin is unable to find flaw with your craftsmanship. Thus satisfied, he bids you deliver the bow to Gairhard at the Adders' Nest."
3,"TEXT_CLSWDK008_00537_SEQ_03","Somewhat surprised by Beatin's presumption, Gairhard explains that the bow you crafted is intended for another archer under his command. The captain still wields the same maple longbow that the timbermaster crafted for him many years ago. Return to the Carpenters' Guild and speak with Beatin."
4,"TEXT_CLSWDK008_00537_SEQ_04","Beatin displays mixed emotions upon learning that Gairhard still carries his old longbow. He muses on the revelation briefly, before remembering your presence and subsequently dismissing you.

※The next carpenter quest will be available from Beatin upon reaching level 45."

72,"TEXT_CLSWDK008_00537_BEATINE_000_035","Surely that longbow is no more than a mangled stick at this point. If it were to break during battle, he would only have himself to blame."
73,"TEXT_CLSWDK008_00537_BEATINE_000_036","Ugh, but I cannot stand idly by while he... <sigh> No, no, I will give this no more thought. He is an experienced soldier; he would never be so reckless..."
