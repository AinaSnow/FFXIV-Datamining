52,"TEXT_MANFST304_00513_100050_MINFILIA","We have conducted a study at the behest of the Order of the Twin Adder."
53,"TEXT_MANFST304_00513_100060_MINFILIA","Papalymo, Yda─a synopsis, if you would."
54,"TEXT_MANFST304_00513_100070_PAPALYMO","Our task was to survey the behavior of the sylphs, a beast tribe indigenous to the Twelveswood."
55,"TEXT_MANFST304_00513_100080_YDA","Oh, how to describe them... They look like...gysahl greens? Floating ones! That worship the primal Ramuh."
56,"TEXT_MANFST304_00513_100090_PAPALYMO","Ahem. Though technically a “beast tribe,” sylphs are blessed with a comparatively personable demeanor, conducive to peaceful communication."

60,"TEXT_MANFST304_00513_100130_YDA","Which leaves Gridania with the added worry of not knowing what they should be worrying about!"
61,"TEXT_MANFST304_00513_100140_PAPALYMO","In that regard, they are hardly alone. What we <Emphasis>can</Emphasis> say with absolute certainty is that Gridania has its hands full fending off Garuda."
62,"TEXT_MANFST304_00513_100150_PAPALYMO","Who, I need hardly remind you, is among the most savage and terrible of all known primals."
63,"TEXT_MANFST304_00513_100160_MINFILIA","In short, it is essential that we approach the sylphs in as diplomatic a manner as possible."
64,"TEXT_MANFST304_00513_100170_MINFILIA","Words and actions can be misconstrued. The only sure way to communicate our intentions is the Echo."
65,"TEXT_MANFST304_00513_100180_MINFILIA","Winning the sylphs' favor may well bring us a step closer to mitigating the threat of the primals. Will you help us?"

67,"TEXT_MANFST304_00513_100200_THANCRED","Lovely! Well, as much as I'd like to help, I'm afraid I would be of little use to anyone in Gridania. A veritable babe in the woods."
68,"TEXT_MANFST304_00513_100210_THANCRED","Yda and Papalymo, however, should be able to see the forest for the trees. Is that not so, Minfilia?"
