Given the multitude of problems facing the realm, they are always looking for capable individuals to join their cause, and it appears your recent exploits have drawn their attention. The Scions are headquartered in an establishment called the Waking Sands, located in Vesper Bay, out in western Thanalan. Make your way there and identify yourself to the guardsman at the entrance."
2,"TEXT_MANFST206_00509_SEQ_02","At the entrance to the Waking Sands, you find not a guardsman but a singing Lalafell by the name of Tataru, who informs you that the Antecedent awaits within. Let the door guard know when you are ready to be shown through."

At the end of a lengthy exposition, she implores you to lend your strength to the Scions' cause, and entrusts you with the order's password: “wild rose.”"
