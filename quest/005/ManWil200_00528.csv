203,"TEXT_MANWIL200_00528_KANESENNA_000_185","For the greater part of its history, Garlemald was not even among the most influential nations in Ilsabard, the northern continent. However, its innovations in the field of magitek, some fifty years past, helped to raise it from the depths of obscurity."

205,"TEXT_MANWIL200_00528_KANESENNA_000_187","Yet Garlemald's transformation did not come about by virtue of magitek alone. Its success owed much to the consummate leadership of its first and reigning emperor."
