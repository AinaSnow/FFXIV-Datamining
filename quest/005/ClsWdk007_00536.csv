3,"TEXT_CLSWDK007_00536_SEQ_03","Gairhard thanks you for the bow, explaining that his squad cannot compromise on the quality of their equipment, due to the demanding nature of their reconnaissance missions. Unfortunately, it is because of one such mission that Gairhard will once again be unable to visit the Carpenters' Guild in person. Deliver the news to Beatin."
4,"TEXT_CLSWDK007_00536_SEQ_04","Though he understands the responsibilities Gairhard has as a Twin Adder captain, he nevertheless exhibits an uncharacteristic worry upon hearing of his friend's latest mission. Brushing aside his concerns, he states that you will speak again when next he receives a commission for you.

※The next carpenter quest will be available from Beatin upon reaching level 40."
