50,"TEXT_MANWIL002_00568_MOMODI_000_3","If it weren't for aetherytes, travelin' around Eorzea would be a damn sight more troublesome than it is.

81,"TEXT_MANWIL002_00568_NENEBARU_000_46","But even if you have no intention of wandering beyond the sultanate's borders, it would be prudent for you to attune yourself to any aetherytes you encounter from now on."

86,"TEXT_MANWIL002_00568_SESEROGA_000_52","My dear adventurer, when you ask an Ul'dahn for a favor, you should at least <Emphasis>try</Emphasis> to make it worth his while. Judging by your garb, I rather doubt you could afford my services, but the fact you offer nothing is laughable."

93,"TEXT_MANWIL002_00568_SESEROGA_000_59","Anything a man could ever desire can be purchased here─provided as he has sufficient funds."
94,"TEXT_MANWIL002_00568_SESEROGA_000_60","Surely there's something you seek, adventurer? A deadlier sword, perhaps, or a shinier trinket? Whatever it is you want, the exchange will have it."
95,"TEXT_MANWIL002_00568_SESEROGA_000_61","To the north, you will find merchants peddling armor and accessories, curatives and crafting materials."
96,"TEXT_MANWIL002_00568_SESEROGA_000_62","And to the south, you will find weapons, tools, and an assortment of other useful items for sale."
97,"TEXT_MANWIL002_00568_SESEROGA_000_63","Seek out a particular merchant, or browse to your heart's content. But do try to remain aloof should you find something that piques your interest. Decisions made in the heat of the moment are usually unwise, especially where coin is concerned."
98,"TEXT_MANWIL002_00568_SESEROGA_000_64","Ahem. That is all the complimentary aid you shall have from me─and <Emphasis>far too much</Emphasis> for my taste."

100,"TEXT_MANWIL002_00568_MOMODI_000_70","How was your tour of the city, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? Get lost, did you?"
101,"TEXT_MANWIL002_00568_MOMODI_000_71","Aye, well, Ul'dah's a big place with lots to see and do─but wanderin' around aimlessly don't pay the bills. If you're serious about makin' a livin' here, you'll need to remember where things are."
102,"TEXT_MANWIL002_00568_MOMODI_000_72","So when you go explorin', explore like you've got a purpose, eh?"
103,"TEXT_MANWIL002_00568_MOMODI_000_73","All right, then! All that's left is for you to work hard, make money, and spend it here at the Quicksand!"
