However, this year's event is to be no mere memorial, for Jihli has again been visited by the Archons: in her most recent dream, she saw adventurers in spriggan form following an auspicious spriggan, who guided them to a wondrous treasure. She bids you speak with her sylphic helper by the amphitheatre gates, so that you too might be transfigured into the shape of a spriggan, and bring her vision to life.

She asks how you could have discovered the egg that contained this rarest of prizes, and you relate how an unusual spriggan holding a checkered egg drew your attention to it. Jihli is delighted to hear your news, recognizing the auspicious spriggan from her vision in your words. Convinced once more that the Archons' prophecy is coming true, she asks for your assistance in tracking down the auspicious spriggan, that he might guide you to the wondrous treasure of which the Archons spoke."
