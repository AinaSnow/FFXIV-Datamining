1,"TEXT_MANFST404_00519_SEQ_01","Stirred by the familiar roar of the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis>'s engines, Cid endeavors to recall his past; try though he might, he is unable to navigate the dark corridors of his mind alone. But what if he had company? Wielding the power of the Echo, you guide him through a series of forgotten memories, detailing the path that led the once-loyal engineer to turn his back on Garlemald and flee to Eorzea. When you finally awake from the visions, Cid triumphantly declares that he remembers everything─his name, his people, and his purpose. Shortly thereafter, he guides the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> through Garuda's wall of wind without incident, delivering you to the Howling Eye at long last. Speak with Alphinaud before proceeding into the primal's sanctuary."

Yet the beastmen's prayers come to naught when Garuda's attempt to temper you fails, prompting a mysterious force to tear a Crystal of Light from her breast. It is at this moment that Gaius van Baelsar enters the fray, seemingly bent on goading the defeated primal into one final act of defiance. Garuda duly obliges, slaughtering her captive kobolds and Amalj'aa, whose cries of agony serve to summon their own patron deities. As Garuda prepares to consume the aether of her lesser brethren, the Black Wolf calls forth an unknown imperial weapon which summarily dispatches and seemingly <Emphasis>absorbs</Emphasis> all three primals. Wholly unprepared to face this awe-inspiring new foe, you have no choice but to flee for your life."
4,"TEXT_MANFST404_00519_SEQ_04","Safely back aboard the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis>, with the imperial forces now fast-diminishing specks upon the horizon, Cid and Alphinaud begin to discuss how to address this grave new threat.

Having safely arrived in Ul'dah, speak with Alphinaud prior to continuing on to Vesper Bay."
5,"TEXT_MANFST404_00519_SEQ_05","Alphinaud reiterates that the beast tribes and their primals are no longer a threat, and that all efforts must now be focused upon destroying the Empire's ultimate weapon. But having seen what you have seen, it is plain that this task will ask far more of you than any you have undertaken thus far. For Eorzea's sake, you must hope that you are up to the challenge."
