1,"TEXT_CLSALC250_00583_SEQ_01","The guildmaster concludes that the duty forced upon him by his colleagues is more suitable for his assistant's continued education. Synthesize a high-quality pinch of natron and deliver it to your manic instructor."

Should you perform one last task for Severian, he promises to permit you to assist him as he seeks to uncover the ultimate secret of alchemy. Until that time comes, you must endeavor to attain ever-loftier heights of skill in your chosen discipline.

※The next alchemist quest will be available from Severian upon reaching level 30."

But when I consider the ease with which you performed your prior task and my desire to find a greater challenge to test your alchemical aptitude, the solution to this onerous situation becomes glaringly obvious."
