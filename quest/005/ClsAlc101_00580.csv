49,"TEXT_CLSALC101_00580_SEVERIAN_001","My mewling subordinates have requested that I put aside my personal research “for but a moment or two” and shoulder a portion of the guild's workload, even going so far as to force upon me some other alchemist's petty task."
50,"TEXT_CLSALC101_00580_SEVERIAN_002","What fools to think I am the sort of guildmaster that contributes in such a mundane capacity! If they had wanted an accommodating drudge to head the guild, then they should not have elected me to the post!"
51,"TEXT_CLSALC101_00580_SEVERIAN_003","Gods know there are others about the Phrontistery who would have been better suited to the leadership position. <sigh> It is times such as these that I curse my blood ties to the Syndicate.
