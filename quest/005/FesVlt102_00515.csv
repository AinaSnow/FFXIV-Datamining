He recognizes its craftsmanship as that of his sweetheart, confirming that he is indeed the swain you seek. He returns to Gridania to be reunited with his lady love, and to prepare a gift of his own. All that remains is to return to Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre, and report your success to the emissary."

But there is another whose suit remains unanswered: it seems that Ser Hortefense searches for his own lost love─a “noblewoman of paramount virtue.” Might this fit the description of anyone you know?"
