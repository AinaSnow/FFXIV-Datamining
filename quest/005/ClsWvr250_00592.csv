2,"TEXT_CLSWVR250_00592_SEQ_02","Your meeting does not prove as enlightening as you had hoped due to the complete disinterest of your young client. Return to the Weavers' Guild and tell Redolent Rose what you have learned."
3,"TEXT_CLSWVR250_00592_SEQ_03","After a moment's consideration, Redolent Rose decides to craft a velveteen dress. Conscious of Babawai's reputation for exacting standards, he concludes that only the finest fabric will suffice. Weave a bolt of high-quality velveteen and deliver it to the guildmaster."
4,"TEXT_CLSWVR250_00592_SEQ_04","The guildmaster praises your velveteen, and assures you that it will make a most magnificent dress─albeit one which he suspects Kokomo has no intention of wearing.

Alas, I have just this moment received yet another request─this time from Her Grace─which must, naturally, take precedence."

56,"TEXT_CLSWVR250_00592_BABAWAI_021","As for what manner of dress... Simply put, I'll not have my Kokomo garbed in common cotton. A jeweler's daughter must be refined─<Emphasis>resplendent</Emphasis>. A ruby amongst the riffraff."
