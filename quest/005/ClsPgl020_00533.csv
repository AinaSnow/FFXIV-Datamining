54,"TEXT_CLSPGL020_00533_HAMON_000_23","...What? You're here to enroll? Ohoho, well, why didn't you say so sooner!? In my capacity as guildmaster, I would be glad to give you a primer on the art of hand-to-hand combat!"
55,"TEXT_CLSPGL020_00533_HAMON_000_24","Doubtless you already know this, but we pugilists fight with our fists and feet. While these don't deal as much damage as a blade, it hardly matters when you can land several blows for each swing of the sword. What we lack in destructive force, we more than make up for in speed and cunning. Under my guidance, not only will you master striking techniques..."
56,"TEXT_CLSPGL020_00533_HAMON_000_28","You'll also learn to string them together to deliver an endless flurry of blows! Only through such fierce combinations can a pugilist realize his potential! Yaaarrrgh!"

58,"TEXT_CLSPGL020_00533_HAMON_000_30","Ah, right. Joining the guild. Before you do so, I must warn you that the path of the pugilist is long and arduous. Do you believe you've got what it takes to go the distance? Be honest with yourself, now!"
