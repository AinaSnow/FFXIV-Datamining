1,"TEXT_CLSWVR150_00590_SEQ_01","The guildmaster wishes to reward a regular customer's loyalty with his choice of bespoke garments. Meet with Wawarukka on Onyx Lane and offer your services."
2,"TEXT_CLSWVR150_00590_SEQ_02","Wawarukka is surprised by your generous offer, as he does not consider himself a regular customer, his many purchases having been made on behalf of the Miners' Guild. Loath to look a gift chocobo in the mouth, however, he asks you to craft a cotton scarf and a pair of cotton shepherd's slops for him. Prepare the requested garments and deliver them to Redolent Rose, ready for a final fitting."
3,"TEXT_CLSWVR150_00590_SEQ_03","Although Redolent Rose offers to provide Wawarukka with even finer garments, the miner is more than satisfied with the scarf and slops you have made. The guildmaster can only defer to the customer's decision.

※The next weaver quest will be available from Redolent Rose upon reaching level 20."
