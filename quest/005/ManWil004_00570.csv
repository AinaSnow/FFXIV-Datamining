50,"TEXT_MANWIL004_00570_MOMODI_000_3","If it weren't for aetherytes, travelin' around Eorzea would be a damn sight more troublesome than it is.

You ever attuned with an aetheryte before, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? If not, just lay your hand on the thing and you'll see what I mean."
51,"TEXT_MANWIL004_00570_MOMODI_000_4","When you've done that, I want you to pay a visit to the Thaumaturges' Guild, over at Arrzaneth Ossuary."

61,"TEXT_MANWIL004_00570_MOMODI_000_14","A lot of folk are lured to this city by the promise of wealth and power. What many of 'em fail to realize is that instead of chasin' after gil the moment they get here, they ought to be makin' friends."

That way, I won't spend my days worryin' that you're down to your smallclothes without a gil to your name."

68,"TEXT_MANWIL004_00570_YAYAKE_000_24","The secrets of these illustrious sorcerers were ultimately entrusted to the priests of the Order of Nald'thal, who have passed them down from generation to generation ever since."
69,"TEXT_MANWIL004_00570_YAYAKE_000_25","Focused and refined over centuries of use in the Order's funereal rites, the arcane magicks of our ancestors eventually emerged as the art we now know as thaumaturgy."
70,"TEXT_MANWIL004_00570_YAYAKE_000_26","A freezing blizzard to halt corruption; a raging fire to cleanse the corpse; a bolt of lightning to expel the sins of mortal life... The dweomers employed in the preparation of the dead are equally efficacious when applied to the living."
71,"TEXT_MANWIL004_00570_YAYAKE_000_27","It is for this reason that we are feared and respected in equal measure. Thus does our guild thrive, ensconced in the catacombs of Arrzaneth Ossuary─a sanctuary devoted to Thal, divine arbiter of the afterlife."
72,"TEXT_MANWIL004_00570_YAYAKE_000_28","What say you, then, adventurer? If you would plumb the abyssal depths of thaumaturgy, let our learned sages guide your descent!"

76,"TEXT_MANWIL004_00570_NENEBARU_000_42","...AHAHAHAHAHA! Apologies, but I do so relish the opportunity to make that jest. The look on your face was absolutely priceless! Ah, but the fact that you were so easily deceived suggests to me that you are unfamiliar with the use of aetherytes. Allow me to explain."
77,"TEXT_MANWIL004_00570_NENEBARU_000_43","These crystalline agglomerations tap into aetherial energies, and are primarily used as a means to travel swiftly from one place to another."
78,"TEXT_MANWIL004_00570_NENEBARU_000_44","Perchance you have heard of Return and Teleport? Well, these transportation spells make direct use of the aetherytes and their connection to the flow of aether."
79,"TEXT_MANWIL004_00570_NENEBARU_000_45","Given that there is an aetheryte in almost every corner of Eorzea, any adventurer with a mind to explore the realm will wish to seek out and attune <If(PlayerParameter(4))>herself<Else/>himself</If> to each and every one!"
80,"TEXT_MANWIL004_00570_NENEBARU_000_46","But even if you have no intention of wandering beyond the sultanate's borders, it would be prudent for you to attune yourself to any aetherytes you encounter from now on."
81,"TEXT_MANWIL004_00570_NENEBARU_000_47","I pray you found that informative. Should you wish to learn more about aetherytes or transportation magic, I should be happy to answer your questions."
82,"TEXT_MANWIL004_00570_SYSTEM_000_48","You attune with the aetheryte.
You are now able to use the Return spell!"
83,"TEXT_MANWIL004_00570_SESEROGA_000_50","And you are?
...Ho, a newly come adventurer. But of course. Yes, I am Seseroga. What can I do for you?"
84,"TEXT_MANWIL004_00570_SESEROGA_000_51","Ah, you would have me teach you the ways of the marketplace? Very wise. As for my fee... What? You expect me to do it for <Emphasis>free</Emphasis>!? Surely you jest."
85,"TEXT_MANWIL004_00570_SESEROGA_000_52","My dear adventurer, when you ask an Ul'dahn for a favor, you should at least <Emphasis>try</Emphasis> to make it worth his while. Judging by your garb, I rather doubt you could afford my services, but the fact you offer nothing is laughable."
86,"TEXT_MANWIL004_00570_SESEROGA_000_53","Oh. Mistress Momodi instructed you to seek me out, did she? Hmph. Consider yourself fortunate to have such influential friends."
87,"TEXT_MANWIL004_00570_SESEROGA_000_54","I shall be brief, and you shall be attentive."
88,"TEXT_MANWIL004_00570_SESEROGA_000_55","You stand in the Sapphire Avenue Exchange, the busiest and most profitable marketplace in the sultanate."
89,"TEXT_MANWIL004_00570_SESEROGA_000_56","Being advantageously situated in relation to the other city–states, Ul'dah's markets have ever served as both the literal and figurative centers of Eorzean commerce."
90,"TEXT_MANWIL004_00570_SESEROGA_000_57","All the great overland trade routes lead to our city, and the majority of maritime trade between Vylbrand and Aldenard passes through our ports."
91,"TEXT_MANWIL004_00570_SESEROGA_000_58","Because of this, countless companies and consortia have chosen Ul'dah as their base of operations. They see to it that this marketplace is awash with merchants and moneylenders, day and night."
92,"TEXT_MANWIL004_00570_SESEROGA_000_59","Anything a man could ever desire can be purchased here─provided as he has sufficient funds."
93,"TEXT_MANWIL004_00570_SESEROGA_000_60","Surely there's something you seek, adventurer? A deadlier sword, perhaps, or a shinier trinket? Whatever it is you want, the exchange will have it."
94,"TEXT_MANWIL004_00570_SESEROGA_000_61","To the north, you will find merchants peddling armor and accessories, curatives and crafting materials."
95,"TEXT_MANWIL004_00570_SESEROGA_000_62","And to the south, you will find weapons, tools, and an assortment of other useful items for sale."
96,"TEXT_MANWIL004_00570_SESEROGA_000_63","Seek out a particular merchant, or browse to your heart's content. But do try to remain aloof should you find something that piques your interest. Decisions made in the heat of the moment are usually unwise, especially where coin is concerned."
97,"TEXT_MANWIL004_00570_SESEROGA_000_64","Ahem. That is all the complimentary aid you shall have from me─and <Emphasis>far too much</Emphasis> for my taste."
98,"TEXT_MANWIL004_00570_SESEROGA_000_65","My regards to Momodi. Now, off with you!"
99,"TEXT_MANWIL004_00570_MOMODI_000_70","How was your tour of the city, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? Get lost, did you?"
100,"TEXT_MANWIL004_00570_MOMODI_000_71","Aye, well, Ul'dah's a big place with lots to see and do─but wanderin' around aimlessly don't pay the bills. If you're serious about makin' a livin' here, you'll need to remember where things are."
101,"TEXT_MANWIL004_00570_MOMODI_000_72","So when you go explorin', explore like you've got a purpose, eh?"
102,"TEXT_MANWIL004_00570_MOMODI_000_73","All right, then! All that's left is for you to work hard, make money, and spend it here at the Quicksand!"
