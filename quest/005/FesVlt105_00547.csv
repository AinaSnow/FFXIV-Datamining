※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESVLT105_00547_SEQ_01","Amazed at your success in reuniting pining sweethearts with their lost loves, Hortefense entrusts you with his own petition. Some years ago, he was gravely wounded in battle and left to die in a northern snowfield. And he would have done just that, had his life not been saved by a noblewoman of Ishgard─a lady he has searched for ever since. Perhaps Lisette de Valentione might have some inkling as to who the lady might be.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESVLT105_00547_SEQ_02","Hortefense's story seems somehow familiar to Lisette, but she cannot recall the names of the persons involved. She bids you speak with her retainer, the emissary of House Valentione currently stationed outside the amphitheatre gates, to see if he can remember any further details."
3,"TEXT_FESVLT105_00547_SEQ_03","You recount Hortefense's story to the emissary, who immediately discerns the identity of the noblewoman involved. He asks you to return to Lisette, and bid her remain in place while he informs Hortefense of the news."
4,"TEXT_FESVLT105_00547_SEQ_04","The truth is finally revealed: the noblewoman who saved Hortefense's life was none other than Lady Lisette de Valentione herself. Carried away by the excitement of rediscovering his lost love, Hortefense makes a surprise proposal, but is angrily rejected by Lisette. Hortefense is undeterred by her uncharacteristic lack of decorum, however, and the lady reluctantly allows him to remain in her company, provided they begin as friends and nothing more. With Hortefense's lost love discovered, and his long-unspoken ardor confessed, your duties as a laborer of love are finally complete. And while the world below basks in the warmth of passions both revealed and renewed, Countess Arabelle de Valentione smiles down from the heavens, her aims achieved for another year."
