With Chuchuto's aid, you succeed in subduing him, and finally learn his true agenda. Rurukuta only wants his master to live, even if it means swallowing his pride and running from the impending fight. Satisfied that Hamon is in good hands, Rurukuta takes his leave. Return to the Pugilists' Guild and report all that transpired to your guildmaster."

※The next pugilist quest will be available from Hamon upon reaching level 30."
