1,"TEXT_CLSWVR300_00593_SEQ_01","Wawarukka, the miner whose loyal custom Redolent Rose seemed so eager to reward, has approached the guild with another commission. Unusually, however, it would seem he seeks something other than mining gear this time. Speak with Wawarukka to learn the details of his request."
2,"TEXT_CLSWVR300_00593_SEQ_02","Wawarukka is smitten with a girl from a wealthy family, and is eager to make a good first impression. To this end, he wishes to purchase the finest pair of velveteen gaiters money can buy. Craft the items to the best of your ability and deliver them to Redolent Rose."
