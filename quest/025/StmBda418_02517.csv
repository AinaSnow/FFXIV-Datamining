1,"TEXT_STMBDA418_02517_SEQ_01","Lord Hien has his Xaela army, and is ready to return to Doma and lead his people to war against the Empire. Before he leaves the Azim Steppe behind, however, he would pay a visit to his new allies. The most radiant brother of the Oronir, who yet occupy the Dawn Throne, is to be first."
2,"TEXT_STMBDA418_02517_SEQ_02","To everyone's relief, Magnai renews his vow to render aid to the Domans without a second thought. The mood is only slightly spoiled when he then begins to muse aloud about whether or not Cirina could be his long-sought moon. You leave soon after, eager to meet with Sadu and to put the awkward episode behind you."
3,"TEXT_STMBDA418_02517_SEQ_03","Sadu too does not hesitate to reiterate that the Dotharl will gladly go to war for Lord Hien, and that they look forward to a glorious battle in which their souls will burn bright. All commitments reaffirmed, you resume your journey south towards a passage long sealed by the Dotharl's magicks, but no longer."
4,"TEXT_STMBDA418_02517_SEQ_04","Crimson is the dusk and the dawn, death and rebirth. An ending to mark a new beginning. Echoing her earlier words, Cirina impresses upon you not to shirk your destiny, or to fear the storm of blood that awaits you, for in crimson there is life. In crimson there is liberation."
