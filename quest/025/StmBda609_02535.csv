52,"TEXT_STMBDA609_02535_STORMOFFICER_000_020","The imperials underestimated us once, and they paid dearly for it. They may not be so easily deceived next time─but if we cannot fool them, we will simply have to break them!"
53,"TEXT_STMBDA609_02535_ALISAIE_000_025","So that's why the village was unharmed..."

58,"TEXT_STMBDA609_02535_RAUBAHN_000_051","Ala Ghiri is ours, and for a mercy we took it without losing a single man. But we dare not grow complacent─Specula Imperatoris will not be so easily won."
59,"TEXT_STMBDA609_02535_ALPHINAUD_000_052","If I may, General─should we not pause to consider the imperials' motivations? For Zenos to surrender a fortified settlement of strategic importance without so much as firing a shot is...inexplicable."
60,"TEXT_STMBDA609_02535_RAUBAHN_000_053","We searched the village and found no traps or other signs of sabotage. Suspicious though it may be, I will not refuse this gift from our enemy."
61,"TEXT_STMBDA609_02535_RAUBAHN_000_054","The path to Ala Mhigo is through the east─through Specula Imperatoris, and Castrum Abania. It bears repeating, however, that the latter is home to a massive cannon with unparalleled range and destructive power."
62,"TEXT_STMBDA609_02535_PIPIN_000_055","Which means that we will need to strike Specula Imperatoris quickly, both to limit their ability to locate our forces in the field, and to utilize the installation as a shield against attack, as they would doubtless not risk damaging the towers."
63,"TEXT_STMBDA609_02535_ALPHINAUD_000_056","I see... Then we have no choice but to accept what we have been given."
64,"TEXT_STMBDA609_02535_CONRAD_000_057","Aye, that's the way of it. I've no doubt that Zenos has got something planned, but we'll just have to deal with it when the time comes."
65,"TEXT_STMBDA609_02535_RAUBAHN_000_058","To the assault, then. The main host will commence a direct assault on Specula Imperatoris. During this time, I would hold the Scions in reserve at Ala Ghiri to deal with any imperial forces that may be dispatched in response."
