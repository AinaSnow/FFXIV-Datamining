53,"TEXT_STMBDA621_02547_LYSE_000_021","She can receive much better care there, after all. Our infirmary is probably the best place for her, short of sending her to Gridania."

55,"TEXT_STMBDA621_02547_LYSE_000_023","Then it's settled. Naago, go and see about getting us a carriage and an escort. Alphinaud, you should get your sister ready for the journey."

Any news of Krile? She'll be cross if you make her wait too long. As will I."

70,"TEXT_STMBDA621_02547_ALPHINAUD_000_055","We'll find Krile and bring her home. After all, I need her to tell you to stay in bed."
