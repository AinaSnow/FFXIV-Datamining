71,"TEXT_STMBDA615_02541_PIPIN_000_075","Be that as it may, we need not risk everything to seize it. I say we dispatch a small contingent to infiltrate the castrum and secure control of the weapon."
72,"TEXT_STMBDA615_02541_PIPIN_000_076","If the enemy is preoccupied with repairs, we may be able to take them unawares. If, on the other hand, it is indeed a trick, our token force will prove an elusive target─and we will at least know the cannon is operational."
73,"TEXT_STMBDA615_02541_ALPHINAUD_000_077","Either way, it seems well worth the risk. But how are we to infiltrate the castrum?"

75,"TEXT_STMBDA615_02541_PIPIN_000_079","Radiata is home to many who hold menial positions at Castrum Abania and other nearby installations. With the aid of our allies there, I believe we can secure a route into the fortress."
76,"TEXT_STMBDA615_02541_LYSE_000_080","The Resistance will handle this. You may have recruited these informants, but they'll be just as happy working with fellow Ala Mhigans. And at the end of the day, it's our land─our responsibility. Let us do right by Conrad."

89,"TEXT_STMBDA615_02541_ALPHINAUD_000_091","...Castrum Abania is the largest imperial facility in the Peaks, you see, and so the likelihood that Krile is being held captive there is quite high..."
90,"TEXT_STMBDA615_02541_ALPHINAUD_000_092","Dealing with that cannon remains our main objective, of course, but if there is even a chance that Krile might be rescued in the process, I would never forgive myself if I did not take it."
