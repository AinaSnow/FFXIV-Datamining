50,"TEXT_STMBDA616_02542_PIPIN_000_010","Perhaps you recall the night we first met outside the Sil'dihn ruins, under such unfortunate circumstances? I had just returned from a meeting with my Ala Mhigan agents. As I said before, we have been preparing for this day."
51,"TEXT_STMBDA616_02542_SERPENTOFFICER_000_015","We have lost so many men already... If we suffer another defeat like that, this campaign is over."
52,"TEXT_STMBDA616_02542_STORMOFFICER_000_020","We will have our retribution. It is but a matter of time."
53,"TEXT_STMBDA616_02542_RAUBAHN_000_025","Had Alphinaud not volunteered you, I would have asked. If anyone can see this mission through, it's you."
54,"TEXT_STMBDA616_02542_ARENVALD_100_030","We'll be fighting with the main host when the time comes to attack Castrum Abania. I swear by everything that is holy─we won't lose!"
55,"TEXT_STMBDA616_02542_VMAHTIA_100_035","There you go again, getting all worked up...though it could be worse. So long as you don't start saying bollocks like, “I'll never forgive them!” Makes for a terrible battle cry, you know?"
56,"TEXT_STMBDA616_02542_JMOLDVA_100_040","Many of the J tribe call this place home. I shudder to think what would become of them if we fail."

59,"TEXT_STMBDA616_02542_ALPHINAUD_000_031","I took the liberty of reviewing intelligence reports while <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> and Lyse were away, so the settlement is not wholly unfamiliar to me..."
60,"TEXT_STMBDA616_02542_ALPHINAUD_000_032","As the vice marshal indicated, the vast majority of the populace is employed as menial labor in either Specula Imperatoris or Castrum Abania. Perhaps as a result of this, the Resistance has long struggled to make inroads there."
61,"TEXT_STMBDA616_02542_MNAAGO_000_033","Aye, you have the right of it. They got a better deal than most Ala Mhigans─feeding off what scraps the imperials gave 'em. Damned if I know how Marshal Tarupin's agents got one of them to turn his coat."
62,"TEXT_STMBDA616_02542_ALPHINAUD_000_034","I understand your disdain, I do. But I also understand their desire to look after their families by any means necessary..."
63,"TEXT_STMBDA616_02542_ALPHINAUD_000_035","Our contact is a Roegadyn woman. She will ask us a question. After we answer with “courage,” she will know us as friends."

Put together a squadron, Naago. We'll need them soon."

68,"TEXT_STMBDA616_02542_ALPHINAUD_100_039","If there were magitek armor nearby, surely we would have heard them by now?"
69,"TEXT_STMBDA616_02542_ALPHINAUD_200_039","See? What did I tell you? Let us continue on to Specula Imperatoris!"

71,"TEXT_STMBDA616_02542_ALISAIE_000_040","Whew. That would have been an unceremonious ending to our tale."
72,"TEXT_STMBDA616_02542_LYSE_000_045","Heh, nothing to it!"
73,"TEXT_STMBDA616_02542_ALPHINAUD_000_050","Of course there were still soldiers lurking about... Fortunately, they were no match for Lyse. Come─Radiata is not much further."
74,"TEXT_STMBDA616_02542_ALPHINAUD_000_051","Of course, in light of our recent encounter, it would be prudent to proceed with caution and remain vigilant for imperial forces..."
75,"TEXT_STMBDA616_02542_ALISAIE_000_060","I thought they said this was a village? It looks more like a work camp..."
76,"TEXT_STMBDA616_02542_ALPHINAUD_000_065","Nary a soldier in sight. Mayhap they were recalled to Castrum Abania..."
77,"TEXT_STMBDA616_02542_LYSE_000_070","Looks like it's safe to enter. I don't see any imperials..."
78,"TEXT_STMBDA616_02542_LYSE_000_071","Hmm... I don't see smoke above Castrum Abania anymore. Do you think they fixed the cannon already...?"
