66,"TEXT_STMBDA605_02531_ALISAIE_000_046","That would depend. The primal's motives will have been colored by the summoner's state of mind─namely, that of a grieving mother who had just borne witness to her daughter's murder. Though she apparently craved a miracle, she may also have harbored thoughts of vengeance.
Moreover, the Qalyana's conception of Sri Lakshmi may differ from that of the Vira."
