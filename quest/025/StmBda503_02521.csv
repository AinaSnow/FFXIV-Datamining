51,"TEXT_STMBDA503_02521_YUGIRI_000_010","During the rebellion, the imperials turned to their agents among the shinobi, and through their treachery were many of my comrades slaughtered."

57,"TEXT_STMBDA503_02521_LYSE_000_031","Oh, you're here to help? That's a relief. I've been trying to help the villagers in Namai get ready for the operation, but we've run into a few problems..."
58,"TEXT_STMBDA503_02521_LYSE_000_032","You remember how we're supposed to stir up trouble as a diversion, right? Well, the thing is, we don't have enough armor to go around."
59,"TEXT_STMBDA503_02521_LYSE_000_033","I thought the Doman Liberation Front would be able to furnish us with some, but it seems that's not the case. I was about to go and tell Isse─why don't you come too?"
60,"TEXT_STMBDA503_02521_LYSE_000_040","We'll have to come up with a solution somehow."
61,"TEXT_STMBDA503_02521_ISSE_000_050","Oh, you're here too. I heard about those soldiers you and Alisaie encountered. I'm glad you're all right... Ahem. Right, then..."
62,"TEXT_STMBDA503_02521_CHIGUSA_000_051","Isse─we have gathered up all the rope we could find in the village."
63,"TEXT_STMBDA503_02521_MIYAMA_000_052","And every tool with an edge, but it is still not enough. Even a hoe would suffice, but there are no more to spare."

65,"TEXT_STMBDA503_02521_ISSE_000_054","As for more tools...I may have some in my home. Go and search it─take whatever meets your needs."
66,"TEXT_STMBDA503_02521_AZAMI_000_055","I made enough rice balls for everyone─including some special ones for Lady Yugiri. Can I go and give them to her?"

69,"TEXT_STMBDA503_02521_LYSE_000_058","You're doing well, Isse...though I have to ask: have you had any luck finding more armor?"
70,"TEXT_STMBDA503_02521_ISSE_000_059","Unfortunately, no. Unlike weapons, there are no substitutes for proper protection..."
71,"TEXT_STMBDA503_02521_ISSE_000_060","It's not as though we need full suits of imperial plate, but we're not soldiers. If we attack without any equipment, we'll be slaughtered."
72,"TEXT_STMBDA503_02521_LYSE_000_061","The Doman Liberation Front doesn't have any armor to spare. I suppose we could ask Hancock, but there's no telling how long it would take for him to send us supplies..."
73,"TEXT_STMBDA503_02521_LYSE_000_062","Do you have an armorer in the village, or anyone with some skill to fashion armor?"
74,"TEXT_STMBDA503_02521_ISSE_000_063","There is one man. A craftsman who fled the enclave. He is experienced, and may be able to help."
75,"TEXT_STMBDA503_02521_ISSE_000_064","I don't know if I can persuade him to, though. But maybe you two could come with me?"
76,"TEXT_STMBDA503_02521_ISSE_000_065","His name is Tsuranuki, and he lives in Kusakari, in the south. Come with me."

80,"TEXT_STMBDA503_02521_TSURANUKI_000_081","Ones who sing of rebellion? Of liberation? Hah hah hah! Surely they would not think to trouble me with such foolish dreams!"
81,"TEXT_STMBDA503_02521_TSURANUKI_000_082","Oh, go and say what you will. But do not take offense if I die from laughter! Bwahahaha!"
