When X'rhun ponders the destination of the cabal's ship, however, Arya suddenly remembers the assassins speaking of a rendezvous with their mysterious master. Prepare for a confrontation, and join X'rhun and Arya on the Isles of Umbra.

Approach the waiting Duelist, and convey your intention to see this journey through to the end."
8,"TEXT_JOBRDM560_02580_SEQ_08","X'rhun gladly accepts you as a comrade-in-arms, but is surprised to hear Arya express her own desire to help vanquish the cabal's master. Persuaded by her courage and conviction, however, he chooses to welcome the determined young woman into the ranks of the red mages. Together, the three of you must now prepare to face the treacherous Lambard.

※The next red mage quest will be available from X'rhun Tia upon reaching level 58."
