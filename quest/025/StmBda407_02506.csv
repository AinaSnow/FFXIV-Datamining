51,"TEXT_STMBDA407_02506_HIEN_000_020","Now then, Cirina, if you would tell us of the trial we must undertake that we might participate in the Naadam."
52,"TEXT_STMBDA407_02506_CIRINA_000_021","Ah, yes! As I mentioned before, to be recognized as warriors of the Steppe, one must follow in the footsteps of the legendary warrior Bardam."
53,"TEXT_STMBDA407_02506_CIRINA_000_022","He embarked on a great pilgrimage, eschewing cart and horse, and walked for many malms until he came to a holy place, thereafter named Bardam's Mettle. There, at the altar, as he did, you must pray."
54,"TEXT_STMBDA407_02506_CIRINA_000_023","The altar lies deep within the breeding grounds of the yol. To complete your trial, you must tame one. Only then will your trial be complete."
55,"TEXT_STMBDA407_02506_HIEN_000_024","Fair enough. And where is the entrance to Bardam's Mettle?"
56,"TEXT_STMBDA407_02506_CIRINA_000_025","You must journey far, far to the west─beyond Chakha Zoh, where lie the bones of a great and wise woman."
57,"TEXT_STMBDA407_02506_CIRINA_000_026","Beyond the ruins of Ceol Aen, hidden within the mountains is a narrow pass. Follow it, and you will come to Bardam's Mettle."
58,"TEXT_STMBDA407_02506_LYSE_000_027","Sounds to me like it'll be a trial just getting to the trial..."
59,"TEXT_STMBDA407_02506_CIRINA_000_028","More than you may know. On the eve of the Naadam, many strive to improve their fortunes─some by abducting and enslaving the warriors of other tribes."
60,"TEXT_STMBDA407_02506_CIRINA_000_029","Be ever mindful of your surroundings, lest you be taken as well."
61,"TEXT_STMBDA407_02506_HIEN_000_030","Hah! What grim expressions you wear while nodding so powerfully! Warriors such as you are not like to fall en route to a mere rite of passage."
62,"TEXT_STMBDA407_02506_HIEN_000_031","We shall proceed with all due caution, yes, but let us not worry overmuch."
63,"TEXT_STMBDA407_02506_HIEN_000_032","We will overcome this trial, and the next, and the next, until we stand triumphant. That is all there is to it, no?"

65,"TEXT_STMBDA407_02506_CIRINA_000_034","W-Wait, Hien! Oh dear. I knew I would forget."
66,"TEXT_STMBDA407_02506_CIRINA_000_035","Here─take these whistles. Once tamed, your yol will hearken to their call."
67,"TEXT_STMBDA407_02506_LYSE_000_036","Thanks. We'll try them out once we've finished the trial."
68,"TEXT_STMBDA407_02506_LYSE_000_037","Let's catch up to Hien and Gosetsu!"
69,"TEXT_STMBDA407_02506_CIRINA_000_040","It is indeed a perilous journey, but I know you will succeed─as I once did."

72,"TEXT_STMBDA407_02506_LYSE_000_060","Hey...I don't know about you, but I can't shake the feeling someone's watching us."
73,"TEXT_STMBDA407_02506_LYSE_000_061","Cirina did warn us about tribes that kidnap warriors and make them fight for them. Something tells me we're about to meet them..."

78,"TEXT_STMBDA407_02506_HIEN_000_080","Ah, there you are. As you can see, they left us little choice."
79,"TEXT_STMBDA407_02506_HIEN_000_081","I gather you were forced to dispatch a few yourself? So it goes. A few less warriors to face in the Naadam, eh?"
80,"TEXT_STMBDA407_02506_HIEN_000_082","Ceol Aen is not much further. That said, I should be surprised if our would-be masters do not try to subdue us one final time..."
81,"TEXT_STMBDA407_02506_BALLOON_000_083","They are here!? To arms!"
82,"TEXT_STMBDA407_02506_LYSE_000_090","<huff> <puff> This is it! The real trial!"
83,"TEXT_STMBDA407_02506_GOSETSU_000_095","Tread softly. We are for hallowed ground, and the kami are restless..."
84,"TEXT_STMBDA407_02506_HIEN_000_100","Right. This must be the pass that leads to Bardam's Mettle."
85,"TEXT_STMBDA407_02506_HIEN_000_101","They say no foreigners have overcome this trial, but, well, there is a first time for everything, no?"
86,"TEXT_STMBDA407_02506_HIEN_000_102","Perhaps you do not hail from these lands, but your forefathers did. You do them honor to carry on their legacy this day."
