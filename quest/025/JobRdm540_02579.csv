Despite rumors that the ship's trading route brings it into contact with imperial vessels, however, a lack of evidence has discouraged authorities from conducting a full investigation. Examine the cargo belonging to the merchantman, and search for proof of the crew's unlawful deeds."

9,"TEXT_JOBRDM540_02579_SEQ_09","X'rhun reports that the Yellowjackets acted immediately upon confirming his evidence, but by the time their soldiers arrived at the docks the merchantman was already fleeing to open water. Although not the perfect outcome, you have freed Arya from the clutches of the cabal and a fate as a mindless puppet. You wonder what tales she might have to tell once the fog clouding her memory has lifted...
