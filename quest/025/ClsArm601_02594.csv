1,"TEXT_CLSARM601_02594_SEQ_01","H'naanza greets you warmly, but seems concerned by an unexpected announcement from Blanstyr. The forgemaster would have you speak with the veteran craftsman, and discern the reason behind his sudden decision to quit the Armorers' Guild."
2,"TEXT_CLSARM601_02594_SEQ_02","You approach Blanstyr, and he shares with you an epiphany he had upon beholding a helm of unique design. Wishing to infuse his own work with a greater degree of “character,” it would appear Blanstyr has his mind set on studying at the feet of Far Eastern masters. Return to H'naanza, and report what you have learned."
3,"TEXT_CLSARM601_02594_SEQ_03","As you explain Blanstyr's reasoning to the forgemaster, the artisan himself makes an appearance. He attempts to berate H'naanza for prying into his business, but she brushes aside his complaints, explaining that he is welcome to take a leave of absence for the sake of self-improvement. Satisfied that his position at the forge will be waiting for him upon his return, a placated Blanstyr soon departs for his pilgrimage to the Far East. H'naanza promises to inform you should she hear word from the impulsive artisan...

49,"TEXT_CLSARM601_02594_HNAANZA_000_001","Speaking of which, our resident veteran of the forge has built quite the reputation for himself. Our patrons are well pleased with the custom-made quality of his armors."
50,"TEXT_CLSARM601_02594_HNAANZA_000_002","Thus did it come as quite a surprise when he announced his intention to leave the guild..."
51,"TEXT_CLSARM601_02594_HNAANZA_000_003","I questioned him on this sudden change of heart, but the stubborn aurochs refused to divulge his reasons. Despite all that has happened, I suppose he must be uncomfortable confiding aught in me."

56,"TEXT_CLSARM601_02594_BLANSTYR_000_011","...Aye, ye've the right of it. I mean to put the guild behind me."
57,"TEXT_CLSARM601_02594_BLANSTYR_000_012","Now, I've confidence in me skills, an' I reckon that lately I've been forgin' some o' the best pieces o' me career."

59,"TEXT_CLSARM601_02594_BLANSTYR_000_014","After a good bit o' thinkin', though, I came to the realization that me work lacks <Emphasis>character</Emphasis>."
60,"TEXT_CLSARM601_02594_BLANSTYR_000_015","I was just arrivin' at that conclusion, you see, when I saw an adventurer by the Aftcastle wearin' a helm o' the oddest design. I had to stop her an' ask where she got it from."
61,"TEXT_CLSARM601_02594_BLANSTYR_000_016","Ye know what she says? Some envoy from the Far East <Emphasis>gave</Emphasis> it to her for services rendered durin' Heavensturn, or some such."

71,"TEXT_CLSARM601_02594_BLANSTYR_000_035","A “leave of absence,” ye call it? Aye, well I s'pose that works, too. I'm serious about trainin' new skills, but I'd be glad to keep me position at yer forge if ye'd still have me."
72,"TEXT_CLSARM601_02594_BLANSTYR_000_036","Right. I'll take me leave, then, Forgemaster. An' if it ain't too much trouble, I'd appreciate it if ye could see to me clients' needs while I'm gone."

Well, I'm off to seek a ship to the Far East. Keep them fires hot, eh?"
