1,"TEXT_CLSGLD601_02599_SEQ_01","On a sudden visit to the Goldsmiths' Guild, Her Royal Majesty Nanamo Ul Namo informs you of her initiative to breathe new life into Ala Mhigo's war-stalled economy. The plan involves establishing an artisans' school training goldsmiths, and the sultana would have you be its schoolmaster. Betokening her hopes for the school, she donates a priceless heirloom for use in your work─her lady mother's jewel-studded crown─and you cannot help but oblige her request. Your apprentices-to-be have already gathered at Spineless Basin in central Thanalan, and Marcel bids you join him there for a meet and greet."

Until such time as the lessons begin, continue honing your craft that you might be better prepared for the challenges of training a new generation of goldsmiths─and ultimately contribute to Ala Mhigo's economic revival.
