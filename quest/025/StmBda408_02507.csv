1,"TEXT_STMBDA408_02507_SEQ_01","If you are to participate in the Naadam and fight alongside the Mol, you must first be recognized as a warrior of the Steppe. To earn this honor, you will be required to complete a rite of passage involving walking in the footsteps of the legendary hero Bardam and taming a yol. Each member of your party must do this by themselves, of course, and so you shall...though if by pure coincidence some of your fellow adventurers happened to have made the long journey to the Far East, and simply <Emphasis>insisted</Emphasis> on accompanying you...surely no one would be any the wiser.

※Bardam's Mettle can be accessed via the Duty Finder."

With a blow, you summon your respective yols, which circle in the skies above in acknowledgment of your new bond. There can be no doubt: you are now warriors of the Steppe."
