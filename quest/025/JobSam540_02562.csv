1,"TEXT_JOBSAM540_02562_SEQ_01","In the course of an inadvertent brush with the law, Musosai has learned that a serial killer has been terrorizing Limsa Lominsa. What is more, the murderer's weapon of choice appears to be a katana, meaning you may be dealing with a fellow samurai. At Momozigo's suggestion, you turn your steps towards Hawkers' Alley, there to ask the locals about the criminal."
2,"TEXT_JOBSAM540_02562_SEQ_02","The shopkeepers on Hawkers' Alley inform you that the victims have thus far been a traveler, a regular patron, and a Qiqirn. There appears to be no connection between them, at least on the surface. With your information combined with his, perhaps Musosai will be able to glean a new lead."
3,"TEXT_JOBSAM540_02562_SEQ_03","Musosai deducts that the killer targets defenseless individuals on the pier, in the black of night. He proposes luring the criminal out with a trap, and Momozigo reluctantly accepts his role as the bait. With that settled, your companions set off for Fisherman's Bottom, where they will set the trap."
4,"TEXT_JOBSAM540_02562_SEQ_04","The killer shows as anticipated, but is spooked by Momozigo's ear-piercing shriek and runs off before you are able to act. All is not in vain, however, for Musosai recognizes the blade the criminal brandished. It would seem the suspect is a Lalafellin merchant who harbors a fetish for Far Eastern blades. Momozigo mentions Gegeruju, the master of Costa del Sol, though he is not entirely convinced of his guilt. For want of another lead, however, Musosai decides to confront the man at his resort."
5,"TEXT_JOBSAM540_02562_SEQ_05","Laughing off your accusations, Gegeruju gives you the name of one Gurumi Borlumi, a rival merchant who is obsessed with all things Far Eastern and has a katana collection besides. Based on what you are told, it seems beyond doubt that this is the killer you seek. To help you infiltrate the man's ship, which lies at anchor off the coast, Gegeruju furnishes you with an invitation to a banquet along with a disguise for Momozigo. With this, you should be able to have Gurumi Borlumi's retainer ferry you to his master's ship."
6,"TEXT_JOBSAM540_02562_SEQ_06","The invitation and disguise work like a charm, and you are shown to Gurumi Borlumi's ship, all decked out in a gaudy caricature of the Far East. When Musosai confronts the man about the killings, he readily owns up to them, his eyes glinting with a sick pleasure. He unleashes his cavalcade of guards upon you, from false shinobi to his pet Yanxian beast to finally his chief bodyguard, a samurai pretender named Ostyrgrein. Between you and Musosai, you overcome all of Gurumi Borlumi's men, whereupon he promptly turns tail and abandons ship. Musosai sets off in pursuit, with you not far behind."
7,"TEXT_JOBSAM540_02562_SEQ_07","You catch Gurumi Borlumi as he reaches the pier at Costa del Sol, where he learns to his shock that he had been facing a legendary swordsman all this time. Nonetheless, he is unwilling to admit defeat, and placing undue faith in his katana, turns it upon Musosai. Deeming the man beyond redemption, your master summarily puts an end to him. But no sooner does the old man declare your work done than he falls to his knees for his recent exertions. Regaining his feet, he assures you all is well and bids Momozigo lead the way to the next stage of your quest: the forest nation of Gridania."
8,"TEXT_JOBSAM540_02562_SEQ_08","You arrive in Gridania and join your companions at the Carline Canopy. While Musosai seems to enjoy being in the forest nation, Momozigo is evidently uncomfortable and excuses himself to go and make inquiries. Until such time as a new evil is identified, you resolve to further hone your skills as a samurai.

※The next samurai quest will be available from Musosai upon reaching level 56."
