1,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_SEQ_01","As part of your continuing lessons, Fugetsu has decided that you will accept a commission from one of Kokajiya's clients. Head to Tenkonto and speak with the samurai Gyosei."
2,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_SEQ_02","You meet with Gyosei, and he explains that he requires a helm for participation in a tournament known as the gozen-jiai. Blanstyr proposes a friendly contest where you both craft a piece, and have the client decide which he likes best. Return to Kokajiya, and discuss the subject of supplies with Unryu."
3,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_SEQ_03","Before you begin forging, Unryu suggests that you first ask the advice of those with more intimate knowledge of the gozen-jiai. He sends you to speak with the same Sekiseigumi blade you consulted once before, as well as a stallkeeper in the Rakuza District."
4,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_SEQ_04","After speaking with the blade and the stallkeeper, you learn that a simple somen─a faceplate which protects the head from brow to jaw─is considered the most appropriate headgear for the tournament. Head back to Unryu, and make a request for materials."
5,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_SEQ_05","Unryu hands over the supplies you need. Deliver your finished work to Fugetsu when the somen is complete.

※In the event you lose the ingredients or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Unryu."
6,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_SEQ_06","You deliver your work to Fugetsu, and the master puts it on display next to Blanstyr's piece. Much to Blanstyr's surprise, however, Gyosei chooses your simple somen over your fellow apprentice's elaborate kabuto. Fugetsu chides Blanstyr for prioritizing a selfish desire to express originality over meeting the client's practical requirements, and the veteran artisan admits his fault. Continue your lessons alongside the repentant Blanstyr, and work towards perfecting the arts you have learned in Kokajiya.

※The next armorer quest will be available from Blanstyr upon reaching level 70."

74,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_UNRYU_000_031","I wonder, however, if you are familiar with the gozen-jiai and what might be considered preferable armor. Before you begin, why not ask the advice of those with the relevant experience?"
75,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_UNRYU_000_032","One such person might be the Sekiseigumi blade who shared with you his ideas on the perfect kote. He will have participated in the tournament in question, and is thus in possession of an invaluable perspective."
76,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_UNRYU_000_033","Another fine choice would be a stallkeeper in the Rakuza District. Such a merchant will have traded in many types of armor, and could provide you with a broader range of ideas."

80,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_ZOUSENOTOKO02597_000_041","I see, and this time you are to craft headgear for a gozen-jiai participant. First and foremost, the tournament takes place before a significant gathering of the nobility. As such, it is best to avoid ostentatious designs or gaudy color combinations."
81,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_ZOUSENOTOKO02597_000_042","When I myself joined the tournament, I also found it advantageous to wear a facemask which allowed a wide field of vision. That is all I can tell you of armor─your client's success will otherwise rely upon his own skill."
82,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_SHONIN02597_000_045","Closer, my friend! Come closer! See anything you like?"
83,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_SHONIN02597_000_046","Eh? Headgear for the gozen-jiai? Well, each combatant has his preferences, but most will choose a facemask of some kind. There's the hatsuburi which protects the brow and cheeks, and the somen─a fuller version which stretches further down and across the jaw."
84,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_SHONIN02597_000_047","I've seen warriors who bind their head with naught but a hachimaki...and I've seen the same warriors carried out with cracked skulls. A strip of cloth affords poor protection, you'll find."
85,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_ZOUSENOTOKO02597_000_048","Remember to avoid gaudy designs and colors─such choices are considered tasteless when courting noble employers. Also keep in mind that a warrior appreciates an unrestricted view of the battlefield."

88,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_UNRYU_000_061","A somen, is it? Very well. One moment and I'll see what we have..."

90,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_UNRYU_000_063","As always, I will replace your materials should you happen to slip with your hammer. I am a generous quartermaster. Oh, and I believe you are to present your work to Master Fugetsu when it is ready."

I have made my decision!"

103,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_GYOSEI_000_080","The gozen-jiai is a tournament─not a life-or-death battle. While certain precautions must still be taken, it is not needful nor desirable to don the heaviest armors available."
104,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_GYOSEI_000_081","And when fighting before the nobility, it is considered tactless to draw attention with aught besides one's skill with the blade. A simple facemask is sufficient to put one's mind in the right frame for battle."
105,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_BLANSTYR_000_082","But ye didn't... Can't ye just─"
106,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_FUGETSU_000_083","Enough, apprentice! The client has decided, and the matter is settled!"
107,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_FUGETSU_000_084","Furthermore, it would seem you are in need of instruction regarding the “original” design of your kabuto."
108,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_FUGETSU_000_085","You once confided in me that the sight of a Heavensturn helmet drove you to seek originality in your own work."
109,"TEXT_CLSARM680_02597_FUGETSU_000_086","I fear, however, that you misunderstand the motive behind the uniqueness of those designs."
