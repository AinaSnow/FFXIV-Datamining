1,"TEXT_JOBRDM580_02581_SEQ_01","X'rhun has contacted an acquaintance in Limsa Lominsa to help investigate possible targets for Lambard and his cabal. Make your way to Hawkers' Round, and rendezvous with the Crimson Duelist."
2,"TEXT_JOBRDM580_02581_SEQ_02","X'rhun's contact is revealed to be Riol, a former member of the Company of Heroes. Riol tells you that he decided to track the merchantman's trade goods back to their source, and discovered a link to Castrum Meridianum in northern Thanalan. Considering the relation between Lambard and the Empire, you conclude that this imperial base is likely the source of the cabal's orders. Speak with X'rhun in the Drowning Wench, and devise a plan of action."
3,"TEXT_JOBRDM580_02581_SEQ_03","X'rhun proposes a simple but effective plan for gaining access to the castrum's records. Head to northern Thanalan, and regroup with your companions in Raubahn's Push."

6,"TEXT_JOBRDM580_02581_SEQ_06","You rejoin your companions, and X'rhun reports success in uncovering Lambard's next objective. Withdraw to the Ceruleum Processing Plant and hear the details from the Crimson Duelist."
7,"TEXT_JOBRDM580_02581_SEQ_07","X'rhun shares with you the disturbing origins of the cabal's formation, and reveals that Lambard has been ordered to strike at a new target: the Garlond Ironworks. Rather than eliminate Cid directly, however, the Empire plans to destabilize the famous company by going after its senior staff members. Such a crippling blow to the Ironworks would have repercussions across Eorzea, and it seems the cabal will stop at nothing to achieve its objective. Lambard must be defeated.

※The next red mage quest will be available from X'rhun upon reaching level 60."
