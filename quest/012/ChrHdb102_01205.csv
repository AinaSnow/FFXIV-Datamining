1,"TEXT_CHRHDB102_01205_SEQ_01","Eager to resume his activities as an agent of enquiry, Inspector Hildibrand departs for Ul'dah in search of a new case. Though you would be entirely justified in leaving him to his own devices, it would be understandable if curiosity compelled you to do otherwise. Consider questioning the residents of Ul'dah for any information regarding the inspector's activities or recent incidents which may draw his attention."

Brushing aside his inquiries, Inspector Hildibrand proclaims his desire to catch the thieving duelist, persuading Wymond to part with information regarding an incident which may be related. However, before Wymond can divulge the name of the victim, Inspector Hildibrand and his assistant abruptly depart, leaving you alone with Wymond and his exasperation."
