She urges you to convey the good news to Master Mimidoa in Aleport, that the two might commence their work."

In hearing the painful truth from her master's mouth, the young smith is finally able to come to terms with that which she had long since suspected, and she resolves to devote herself to the restoration effort to honor the memory of her family."
