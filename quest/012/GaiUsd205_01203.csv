1,"TEXT_GAIUSD205_01203_SEQ_01","Now that a path through the Labyrinth of the Ancients has been secured, it is time for the fellowship of NOAH to discuss the next stage of the expedition. Begin by apprising Rammbroes of your progress."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSD205_01203_SEQ_02","The most significant finding of your initial survey is also the most obvious: namely that the long-dormant mechanisms of the Crystal Tower have somehow been reawakened. In order to ascertain what coaxed them into motion after several thousand years of stillness, there is no recourse but to forge onwards and upwards into the spire itself. Given the danger inherent in this proposition, however, it is agreed that no further forays should be made until Cid and his assistants have conducted an exhaustive analysis of the tower's next line of defense. Faced with the prospect of a lengthy delay, G'raha Tia warns you against idleness, doubtless anticipating that the challenges to come will punish any hint of rustiness in your technique."

50,"TEXT_GAIUSD205_01203_RAMMBROES_000_010","Welcome back, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I have just been reading about your encounter in the Labyrinth of the Ancients. It pleases me greatly to note that you seem none the worse for the experience."
51,"TEXT_GAIUSD205_01203_RAMMBROES_000_011","For your reference, I have added my own notes to G'raha's preliminary expedition report, and begun compiling a Crystal Tower survey log. The information contained therein will be available to you at all times. Should you have any questions, you need only ask."

54,"TEXT_GAIUSD205_01203_RAMMBROES_000_021","According to <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>'s account, the labyrinth's defenses were most emphatically active.

55,"TEXT_GAIUSD205_01203_CID_000_022","In short: our misgivings were well founded. The Crystal Tower was not simply thrust above ground by the chaotic shifting of earth─it has somehow been <Emphasis>reawoken</Emphasis>."
56,"TEXT_GAIUSD205_01203_CID_000_023","If, as seems increasingly likely, the tower's secrets should prove too dangerous to share with the world, we will have no choice but to contain them. Short of leveling the place, this will almost certainly involve returning its mechanisms to a state of dormancy. To do <Emphasis>that</Emphasis>, however, we will first need to address the question of how they work─the answer to which must surely be waiting for us inside the tower itself. In conclusion: that is where we must go."
57,"TEXT_GAIUSD205_01203_GRAHATIA_000_024","A task rather easier said than done, if the perils of the labyrinth are any indication..."
58,"TEXT_GAIUSD205_01203_RAMMBROES_000_025","Then I move that all further exploration of the tower be delayed until such time as an exhaustive analysis of the structure's defenses has been completed. Master Garlond, may I entrust this task to you?"

64,"TEXT_GAIUSD205_01203_RAMMBROES_000_031","You'll do nothing of the sort, G'raha. Your knowledge may prove useful to Master Garlond's investigation."

68,"TEXT_GAIUSD205_01203_RAMMBROES_000_035","And with that encouraging thought in mind, it is time to bring this assembly to a close. Let us all focus on the tasks at hand, that our next expedition may begin all the sooner. Meeting adjourned!"

74,"TEXT_GAIUSD205_01203_NERO_000_045","I believed the fates had conspired to deny me my just rewards once again...but it would seem they had a greater destiny in mind for me."
