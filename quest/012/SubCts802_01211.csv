2,"TEXT_SUBCTS802_01211_SEQ_02","The miner puts little stock in the tall tales of his drinking companion, strongly advising you against chasing after apocryphal fortunes. Should you choose to ignore his warning, you may find the would-be treasure hunter Ealdwine where X marks the spot to the southeast of Camp Bronze Lake."
3,"TEXT_SUBCTS802_01211_SEQ_03","Self-styled treasure hunter Ealdwine reeks heavily of his namesake and has likely not seen a bath in several moons. He invites you─for better or for worse─to open, in his stead, an unearthed casket, which he absolutely, positively, beyond-a-shadow-of-a-doubt assures you is not trapped."

6,"TEXT_SUBCTS802_01211_SEQ_06","Showing considerably more concern for his own coinpurse than your ordeal, Ealdwine nevertheless encourages you to join him in the hunt for treasure, imparting to you the skill of map-reading to serve this end. Notwithstanding the liable nature of your mentor, who is to say what treasures lie hidden across the realm? With your newfound knowledge, strike forth in search of riches and glory."
