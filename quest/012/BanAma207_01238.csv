1,"TEXT_BANAMA207_01238_SEQ_01","After educating you on the Amalj'aa's distaste for water, Narujj Boh asks that you subject the Brotherhood's foes to a humiliating defeat. Subdue the Flamefang ravagers you encounter in the south of Zanr'ak, and douse them with water from the heavy glass flasks at the moment of your victory."
2,"TEXT_BANAMA207_01238_SEQ_02","You have thoroughly soaked a number of defeated Flamefangs. Return to the Ring of Ash and report to Narujj Boh."
3,"TEXT_BANAMA207_01238_SEQ_03","Narujj Boh appears almost jovial at the news of your success. Though unable to witness the dousing firsthand, the warriors of the Brotherhood are much heartened by reports of the Flamefangs' defeat and subsequent humiliation."

50,"TEXT_BANAMA207_01238_NARUJIBOH_000_002","Among the Amalj'aa, any who drinks water in excess is considered a fool. And, in the same vein, dousing an opponent with the substance constitutes the gravest form of humiliation. Have you perhaps divined my intent?"
