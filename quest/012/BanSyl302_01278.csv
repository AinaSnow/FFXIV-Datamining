1,"TEXT_BANSYL302_01278_SEQ_01","The dark sylphs that inhabit the Sylphlands are at their nastiness again, this time feeding three of Moxia's friends to the sylph-eating gapemaw plants, and sealing their fearsome maws shut to prevent any attempts at escape. The perpetrators of the mischief─violet screeches, sighs, and snarls south of the Hanging Barbs─keep close guard over a lubric substance that might serve to foil their deed. Slay them and acquire the liquid to save the unfortunate sylphs from their fate."

While mildly gruesome, she feels such an act would be only fitting after the anguish they have inflicted upon her people."
