1,"TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_SEQ_01","Assuming the role of expedition leader, G'raha Tia issues instructions to the assembled fellowship of NOAH, detailing how the operation will proceed. Make your way to the large gate located to the southeast of Saint Coinach's Find, and await the arrival of the rest of the survey team."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_SEQ_02","To the great relief of all concerned, the crystal “fangs” make short work of the tower's lethal outer defenses. Reasoning that the structure's inner reaches are like to contain further hazards, Cid volunteers you for the task of securing the Labyrinth of the Ancients. Rid the maze of anything which might pose a threat to the survey team.

※The Labyrinth of the Ancients can be accessed via the Duty Finder."

Cid and G'raha Tia praise your invaluable contribution to the expedition, and together you gaze upon the shimmering spire that rises from the center of the maze."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSD204_01202_SEQ_04","Though your labors in the labyrinth have secured a route to the tower, much remains to be discussed before the expedition can proceed. Return to Saint Coinach's Find and speak with G'raha Tia."
