2,"TEXT_FESVLT003_01299_SEQ_02","Years have passed since the Calamity, yet Nemoh Maimhov patiently awaits the return of her betrothed, a soldier by the name of Gwayne. Recent talk of a visitor to Gridania matching Gwayne's description has filled the young maiden's heart with hope, yet she cannot work up the courage to investigate for herself. Make for Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre and see if there is any truth to the rumors."
3,"TEXT_FESVLT003_01299_SEQ_03","Your search of the Amphitheatre turned up only Gwayne look-alikes, including a childhood friend of Nemoh's whose unrequited love drove him to a desperate act of deception. Your efforts, however, were not entirely unfruitful, as one of the Gwayne-esque individuals was able to provide you with information regarding the man's true whereabouts. Return and share the news with Nemoh Maimhov."
4,"TEXT_FESVLT003_01299_SEQ_04","Though disappointed that Gwayne remains unfound, Nemoh Maimhov holds out hope that the man sighted at E–Tatt's Spire is indeed her lost love. Travel to the spire and seek out the man in question."

Return to Nemoh Maimhov and break the news as softly as you can."
6,"TEXT_FESVLT003_01299_SEQ_06","Refusing to accept that her love has forgotten her, Nemoh unleashes her frustrations on her childhood friend Gylbart, then entrusts you with a box of chocolates to deliver to Gwayne, in hopes that his memory might yet be stirred. Gylbart, shaken but strong, would speak to you out of Nemoh's earshot, and asks that you meet him at E–Tatt's Spire."
7,"TEXT_FESVLT003_01299_SEQ_07","Gylbart shares with you a sad revelation─the man named Gwayne was actually a notorious philanderer who swindled numerous women out of gifts and gil with empty promises of love and marriage. Out of kindness, he spared Nemoh the cruel truth, choosing to play the villain while he worked in secret to apprehend the true criminal. He entrusts Nemoh's chocolates to you, promising to remain by Nemoh's side as a friend, even if that is all he shall ever be."
