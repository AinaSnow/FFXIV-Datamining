It is an honor to cast one's time-tempered soul into the sacred flames, and return one's body to ash."
50,"TEXT_BANAMA002_01218_HAMUJIGAH_000_003","But these craven whelps of Zahar'ak quaver before death's inevitability─they seek not to fortify their spirits, instead groveling before a deity for the strength they do not deserve. "
