All present fear for what might befall the realm if the Chosen One were to fall into the hands of the malevolent touched sylphs. Speak with Olmxio and see if there is anything that can be done."
5,"TEXT_BANSYL002_01253_SEQ_05","Olmxio, expressing grave doubts as to Voyce's abilities, would have you lead the search for the Chosen One. Remain in Little Solace and assist the sylphs as you gather what knowledge you can to prepare for the task ahead."
