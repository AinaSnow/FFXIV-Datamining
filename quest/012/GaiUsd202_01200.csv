1,"TEXT_GAIUSD202_01200_SEQ_01","Rammbroes explains that four varieties of an extremely rare abrasive known as aethersand are required to polish the flawless crystals. Take the purse given to you by the dig supervisor and deliver it to Serendipity, the master of the Goldsmiths' Guild in Ul'dah. It is Rammbroes's hope that the presence of a celebrated adventurer will prompt the goldsmiths to redouble their efforts to procure the required materials."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSD202_01200_SEQ_02","Upon arriving at the Goldsmiths' Guild, you encounter an old friend: Biggs. By some strange coincidence, it appears that the Roegadyn engineer is also intent on purchasing what little aethersand there is to be had. After a somewhat one-sided negotiation, he relinquishes his questionable claim on the only available batch in exchange for a role in the forthcoming expedition. The fire-aspected aethersand thus secured, inquire as to whether Biggs might know where to obtain the three remaining varieties."

Make for Bluefog and seek the Lalafell, who should be accompanied by a hired adventurer bodyguard."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSD202_01200_SEQ_04","According to the adventurer hired to guard Wedge, she last saw her employer during a bungled attempt to retrieve some aethersand which had been stolen by bandits. Betraying scarcely a hint of shame, the bumbling bodyguard speculates that Wedge may still be trapped inside the abandoned Amajina mythril mine which the bandits call home. Make haste to the site and rescue Biggs's stricken friend before it is too late."
5,"TEXT_GAIUSD202_01200_SEQ_05","To your great relief, Wedge bears no scars from his recent ordeal. Unfortunately, he also bears no aethersand, having dropped it whilst fleeing from his pursuers. Search the mine and retrieve the precious mineral before the bandits stumble upon it."

7,"TEXT_GAIUSD202_01200_SEQ_07","Wedge is plainly overjoyed to have the aethersand back, but when he hears of your impending expedition, he decides to surrender the precious mineral to you, reasoning that your need is greater.

8,"TEXT_GAIUSD202_01200_SEQ_08","After delivering the two samples of aethersand, you regale Cid with tales of his indefatigable employees' most recent misadventures. When thoughts subsequently turn to the two outstanding varieties of aethersand, Rammbroes declares that he has made “arrangements” to procure them. Quite what form these arrangements may take is unclear, but his expression betrays no small amount of apprehension..."

Alas, aethersand is neither common nor cheap. Indeed, it is not unusual for the abrasive to exceed the value of the precious stones it is used to polish."
50,"TEXT_GAIUSD202_01200_RAMMBROES_000_002","Given the rarity of the materials in question, the Goldsmiths' Guild in Ul'dah seemed the likeliest place to purchase the quantity we require. When I contacted the guildmaster, however, I was informed that no aethersand was currently available.

I should mention at this point that I placed the order some time before you procured the flawless crystals..."
