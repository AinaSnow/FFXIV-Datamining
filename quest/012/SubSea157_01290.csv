1,"TEXT_SUBSEA157_01290_SEQ_01","Skribyld believes R'kontai may be concealing more jackals for future black market sales. He has requested you speak with her to confirm his suspicions."
2,"TEXT_SUBSEA157_01290_SEQ_02","R'kontai reveals that, although there are no longer jackals in her care, she has a wolf pup in her keeping. Fearing that the pirates will come and take him away, the remorseful merchant begs you to retrieve him. Find the wolf pup and give him a succulent bone to win his trust."

4,"TEXT_SUBSEA157_01290_SEQ_04","You have earned the pup's trust, and he now seems willing to go with you. Make your way back to Skribyld and show him what you found."
5,"TEXT_SUBSEA157_01290_SEQ_05","Skribyld is thrilled to hear that the pup is in good health and safe from the hands of the pirates. Seeing as the pup has grown so fond of you, Skribyld believes it best that he remains in your care."

54,"TEXT_SUBSEA157_01290_RKONTAI_000_014","I have to warn ye, though, he may be a pup, but he'll likely make a meal of anyone what gets close to him.
