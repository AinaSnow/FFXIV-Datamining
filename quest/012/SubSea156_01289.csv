50,"TEXT_SUBSEA156_01289_SKRIBYLD_000_002","Now, it bears mentioning that this species of coeurl isn't native to Vylbrand. By rights, they shouldn't even be here. Nay, I believe they were <Emphasis>smuggled</Emphasis>."

55,"TEXT_SUBSEA156_01289_RKONTAI_000_011","P-Please don't hurt me. I didn't do nothin' wrong. I smuggled in the coeurls for breedin' like ye asked, but that's it! I ain't the one sendin' the jackals into a frenzy, I swear!"

57,"TEXT_SUBSEA156_01289_RKONTAI_000_013","<sigh> Well, ye've caught me. I'm behind the coeurls in Aleport. Those good-for-nothin' pirates had me breed jackals for 'em too. With the right trainin', they make for nasty watchdogs an' the like. But the pirates wanted more, an' that's why they asked me for the coeurls, that they did."
58,"TEXT_SUBSEA156_01289_RKONTAI_000_014","I smuggled 'em in, but the pirates took 'em before I could finish the job. S'pose they didn't want to wait for the breedin', but the buggers let 'em escape. Now they have jackals on the loose tryin' to get rid of the coeurls an' clean their mess. "
59,"TEXT_SUBSEA156_01289_RKONTAI_000_015","I'm a victim as well, ye know. Aye, they paid good coin for the animals, but now they got folk chasin' after me. Wantin' to cover their tracks, I'm sure. You hurry an' tell those Yellowjackets I ain't to blame, you hear?"

62,"TEXT_SUBSEA156_01289_SKRIBYLD_000_022","At any rate, we now know why the coeurls and jackals are trying to tear each other to shreds."
