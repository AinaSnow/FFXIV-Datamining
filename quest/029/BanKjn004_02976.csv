※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANKJN004_02976_SEQ_01","Kabuto recently acquired a suit of armor which he has sent to Kugane for repairs. Fearful the Red Kojin may attempt to steal it, he asks you to accompany him to see it safely returned to Tamamizu. No sooner do you nod in consent than he sets off for the forge in Kugane.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANKJN004_02976_SEQ_02","The two of you are both surprised and delighted to see Shihoumi is the smith entrusted with repairing the armor. Kabuto's cheerful demeanour soon sours, however, when she tells him the armor has been delivered to Hells' Lid. It is just as he feared─a plot by the Red Kojin to steal his treasure. Leaving Tsukumo in her care, he rushes off to Hells' Lid."

4,"TEXT_BANKJN004_02976_SEQ_04","The courier leaves after a quick show of thanks for fear of another attack. As if in response to his worry, Hirumaki appears on a nearby ridge. He claims to have kidnapped Tsukumo, and demands the Blue Kojin pledge their services to the Red Kojin in exchange for his safe return. What, then, has become of Shihoumi? Kabuto asks you to return to Kugane and find out."
5,"TEXT_BANKJN004_02976_SEQ_05","You arrive to find Shihoumi is safe, but Tsukumo's absence confirms Hirumaki's boasts were true. She blames herself for what has happened, pledging to help with Tsukumo's rescue in any way she can. Kabuto thanks her for her generosity, then invites you back to Tamamizu."
6,"TEXT_BANKJN004_02976_SEQ_06","You begin talks with Kabuto when Bunchin approaches, furious at the news that Tsukumo has been taken. He quickly dismisses Kabuto's shortsighted plans of sneaking onto the Isle of Zekki, and insists he speak with all of the Blue Kojin and rally them together in preparation for battle."
