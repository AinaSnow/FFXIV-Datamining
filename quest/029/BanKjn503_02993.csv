49,"TEXT_BANKJN503_02993_ZUKIN_000_001","But even as we enjoy new relations, we do not forget the old. The people of Isari traded with us when no one else would, and we continue to trade with them to this day."

51,"TEXT_BANKJN503_02993_ZUKIN_000_003","The items in question were still being prepared when last we visited, but they should be ready by now. Let me see─dried fish, a wooden bucket, and a fish basket. Will you visit the village in our stead?"
52,"TEXT_BANKJN503_02993_ISARIOLDMAN02993_000_010","You're here from Tamamizu, you say? I've got these dried fish for you to take back."
53,"TEXT_BANKJN503_02993_ISARIOLDMAN02993_000_011","Our Kojin friends always request this. As I hear it, they don't have the right conditions where they live to make sun-dried goods themselves."

55,"TEXT_BANKJN503_02993_ISARIWOMAN02993_000_012","The Tamamizu traders sent you, did they? They brought us some lovely coral the other day, but the bucket we promised them wasn't ready then. It's finished now though!"

59,"TEXT_BANKJN503_02993_ISARIMAN02993_100_014","With the Empire buggering off and leaving us to our waters, demand for fishing gear is higher than ever! I'd run out of baskets just before the traders came to collect theirs."
60,"TEXT_BANKJN503_02993_ZUKIN_000_020","Were you able to collect the goods?"
61,"TEXT_BANKJN503_02993_ZUKIN_000_021","Yes, these will do nicely. You may notice that none of these things are worth much. So why do we trade for these wares? The reason is simple."
62,"TEXT_BANKJN503_02993_ZUKIN_000_022","Isari suffered a great deal under the Empire, with fishing and trade heavily restricted. This is our way of helping, by asking only that which they can afford to give. We shall continue to support them, as they support us."
