50,"TEXT_STMBDB104_02965_ALPHINAUD_000_011","Seconded. There is to be a meeting of representatives from across Ala Mhigo, so she is sure to be in the city. Shall we seek her out?"
51,"TEXT_STMBDB104_02965_LYSE_000_020","Oh? You three look pleased with yourselves. What've you been up to?"
52,"TEXT_STMBDB104_02965_ARENVALD_000_021","I'm glad you asked, Lyse. And I'm pretty sure you're going to like the answer..."

56,"TEXT_STMBDB104_02965_ALPHINAUD_000_025","Arenvald did not exaggerate, I assure you. We could not hope to carry even a fraction of it out on our own. I have taken the liberty of sketching out a rough map of the ruins─if you will assemble a squad of your most trusted freedom fighters, they should be able to follow the route to where the treasure lies."
57,"TEXT_STMBDB104_02965_LYSE_000_026","Understood. I'll make sure every coin is accounted for, and that goes for the spending of it as well!"

59,"TEXT_STMBDB104_02965_ARENVALD_000_028","Oh, there is one other thing: when the time comes to draw up a plan for distributing the spoils, I would ask that you consult Alphinaud."

84,"TEXT_STMBDB104_02965_LYSE_000_073","Sending her to the gallows might satisfy people right now, but where would it end? Should we round up everyone who collaborated? And everyone who didn't resist? There would be no one left! And we'd be no better than Theodoric and Zenos!"
