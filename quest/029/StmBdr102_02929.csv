1,"TEXT_STMBDR102_02929_SEQ_01","For want of a better option, you agree to do as Omega bade you and engage the test subjects inside the Deltascape. While you do battle within, your comrades will provide support without. You will not be entirely alone in there, however; as you will need to make use of Alpha's “existential authorization,” he will go with you into the test world.

※In the event that you leave the Interdimensional Rift, you may re-enter by speaking with the Ironworks hand at the Yawn."

4,"TEXT_STMBDR102_02929_SEQ_04","Outside the Deltascape, your comrades compliment you on a battle well won. When Nero subsequently questions Omega's apparent obsession with determining the strongest being, Midgardsormr appears and explains that, having defeated Shinryu, it now seeks to create a mightier foe to fight. Fearing that the violence of such an encounter would be akin to another calamity, Cid is determined to stop Omega's plan. He duly grants Biggs and Wedge leave to investigate the stasis system in Carteneau, while he and Nero remain in the rift to aid you in the tests to come."

77,"TEXT_STMBDR102_02929_NERO_000_102","Preliminary analysis suggests that there are four combatants in the Deltascape all told, including your friend Alte Roite. Which means you will be required to win three further bouts─with Deltas II to IV─in this test world alone."

83,"TEXT_STMBDR102_02929_MIDGARDSORMR_000_108","...In part. The making of life is not Omega's primary function. It bringeth complex beings into the corporeal realm only at great cost to itself."
84,"TEXT_STMBDR102_02929_MIDGARDSORMR_000_109","As such, it employeth this plane to test unfinished works, that it might determine a single entity worthy of creation."

86,"TEXT_STMBDR102_02929_CID_000_111","Gods help us all if a battle of that scale should come to pass. The powers unleashed would be enough to bring about another calamity."
87,"TEXT_STMBDR102_02929_NERO_000_112","Hm. Assuming the dragon has the right of it, all test subjects must needs be works in progress─save for ourselves, of course. But how then do we explain Alpha? As I recall, it manifested corporeally outside the rift."
88,"TEXT_STMBDR102_02929_NERO_000_113","Then again...it is hardly the most complex of creatures. Mayhap it was finished by accident."

90,"TEXT_STMBDR102_02929_BIGGS_000_115","Er...changing the subject for a moment, Chief─after you lost track of Omega, you said you reengaged its stasis systems, right?"
91,"TEXT_STMBDR102_02929_BIGGS_000_116","...Meaning something somewhere isn't working like it should."
92,"TEXT_STMBDR102_02929_BIGGS_000_117","I only ask 'cause me and Wedge have done pretty much all we can here, and were wondering if it might be worth going to Carteneau to look into it."
93,"TEXT_STMBDR102_02929_CID_000_118","That would be a great help. Nero and I can handle things at this end."
94,"TEXT_STMBDR102_02929_BIGGS_000_119","We'll be off, then. Don't do anything I wouldn't do, eh?"
95,"TEXT_STMBDR102_02929_WEDGE_000_120","And you be a good boy, Alpha. Do as you're told, and look after <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> for me!"
