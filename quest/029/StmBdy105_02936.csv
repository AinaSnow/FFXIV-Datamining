Mayhap you've made an ill name for yourself. No reverence for authority? Trouble getting on with others? No matter. The Hunt will solve all your worries and woes. Kill your quarry and redeem your reputation!"
52,"TEXT_STMBDY105_02936_ESTRILD_000_005","There is no need for fanciful or flowery explanations. Simply hunt, hunt, hunt, and hunt some more! The more monsters that die by your hand, the more the Clan will hold you in high esteem. Heed the call, and prove yourself!"
