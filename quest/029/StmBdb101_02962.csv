0,"TEXT_STMBDB101_02962_SEQ_00","Lyse seems troubled."
1,"TEXT_STMBDB101_02962_SEQ_01","You listen with sympathy as Lyse vents her frustration at the lack of an obvious candidate to lead the newly liberated Ala Mhigo. Everyone but everyone must have a say, it seems, and she duly departs for the city to attend only the Twelve know how many meetings on the subject. You are half-inclined to join her, if only to offer moral support, until Arenvald approaches, dangling the promise of new adventure..."
2,"TEXT_STMBDB101_02962_SEQ_02","Having successfully piqued your interest, Arenvald goes off in search of Alphinaud to complete your adventuring party. Wait for your companions by the Rhalgr's Reach aetheryte."
3,"TEXT_STMBDB101_02962_SEQ_03","After a short wait, Arenvald arrives with Alphinaud, and finally explains the nature of his proposal. In the days before his fall, King Theodoric is reputed to have hoarded the personal wealth of his executed kinsmen, but not a single coin of this fabled fortune has ever been found. Needless to say, Arenvald is determined that you should be the ones to uncover the mad king's trove."

54,"TEXT_STMBDB101_02962_ARENVALD_000_022","Now, the events I would speak of occurred before the occupation─back when Ala Mhigo was still a monarchy, and Theodoric sat the throne."
55,"TEXT_STMBDB101_02962_ALPHINAUD_000_023","A uniquely brutal despot, by all accounts."
56,"TEXT_STMBDB101_02962_ARENVALD_000_024","That he was. The King of Ruin suffered no rivals, real or imagined, and his dispute with the monks of the Fist ended with Rhalgr's Reach being burned to the ground."
57,"TEXT_STMBDB101_02962_ARENVALD_000_025","In the latter years of his rule, he was seized by the unshakable belief that unseen forces were conspiring to steal his crown. And so he ordered that every soul with a claim to the throne be executed─including his own family."
58,"TEXT_STMBDB101_02962_ARENVALD_000_026","The wealth of the poor sods he put to death became the property of the king, and it's said that these royal treasures were hoarded somewhere in the palace. Thus was born the legend of the “mad king's trove.”"
59,"TEXT_STMBDB101_02962_ALPHINAUD_000_027","Ah. I believe I see the direction our adventure is to take. I assume you have a mind to unearth this hidden bounty?"
60,"TEXT_STMBDB101_02962_ARENVALD_000_028","You assume correctly!"
61,"TEXT_STMBDB101_02962_ALPHINAUD_000_029","And would I also be correct in assuming that this legend is widely known? Others must surely have gone in search of your prize, tempting as it seems."
62,"TEXT_STMBDB101_02962_ARENVALD_000_030","Well, of course we won't be the first to make the attempt. Following Ala Mhigo's liberation, more than a few eager soldiers turned the palace upside down in hopes of claiming an easy fortune."
63,"TEXT_STMBDB101_02962_ARENVALD_000_031","But even after scouring every room from dawn till dusk, they uncovered not a single coin. Their gold-lust drained away as quickly as it had come, and the legend of the mad king's trove remains simply that─a legend."
64,"TEXT_STMBDB101_02962_ALPHINAUD_000_032","But I see you have no intention of letting the story end there."
65,"TEXT_STMBDB101_02962_ARENVALD_000_033","What self-respecting adventurer would!? Imagine: the three of us, delving into a decades-old mystery! Tell me the thought doesn't set your heart to racing!"
