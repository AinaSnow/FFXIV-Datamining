Perhaps believing it to be more dramatic, he refrains from telling you what the opportunity actually is, and instead bids you speak with a mysterious veteran who waits for you outside Rhalgr's Reach."
2,"TEXT_STMBDY109_02940_SEQ_02","The veteran tells you of a place called the Circles of Answering, where the monks of the Fist of Rhalgr used to hone body and mind. By the grace of his Doman patron, this training ground has been reborn as Stone, Sky, Sea...in spirit, if not in name. There you may challenge striking dummies tailored to the strengths of various beings fantastic and otherworldly. Should you triumph in the allotted time, you will know you are ready to face them in battle...though whether or not you will survive the actual encounter is an altogether different question. Dummies, after all, do not hit back..."
