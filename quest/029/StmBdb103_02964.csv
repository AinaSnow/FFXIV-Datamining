1,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_SEQ_01","Before unveiling his grand theory, Alphinaud would adjourn to a more appropriate location─specifically, the southern shore of Loch Seld."
2,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_SEQ_02","After favoring you with a short lecture on the history of Loch Seld, Alphinaud posits that the “darkness beneath the palace” referred to by Ernold may contain the submerged remnants of the ancient city of Skalla. He further theorizes that Theodoric had his kinsmen cursed and cast into the depths not only to punish them for their imagined crimes, but to have them serve as guardians over his treasures. Whilst Alphinaud and Arenvald search for a way into the ruins from above, you are to scour the loch bed for an underwater entrance."
3,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_SEQ_03","In the frigid waters of Loch Seld, you discover a passage leading directly beneath the palace foundations. Such a find warrants further investigation..."
4,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_SEQ_04","You have discovered a stone door which appears to offer a way into the ruins beneath the palace. Enter the Drowned City of Skalla, and search for the mad king's trove!

※The Drowned City of Skalla can be accessed via the Duty Finder."

6,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_SEQ_06","As you gaze upon the riches of the mad king's trove, Alphinaud and Arenvald tumble in from a different section of the ruins. Return to the Ala Mhigan Quarter, and recount your respective adventures."
7,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_SEQ_07","With grudging admiration, Alphinaud declares you the victor of the impromptu race to the treasure. Arenvald, meanwhile, seems more intent on teasing Alphinaud for his reaction to one of the ruins' ghostly inhabitants..."

56,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_ALPHINAUD_000_023","It is my belief that the “darkness beneath the palace” mentioned by Theodoric's former scribe was not a reference to the prison, but to a place still further below: the ruins of Skalla."
57,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_ALPHINAUD_000_024","I further surmise that the mad king's unfortunate kinsmen were cast down there not simply out of a desire to punish them, but to discourage exploration. Theodoric wanted to keep the ruins secure..."

59,"TEXT_STMBDB103_02964_ALPHINAUD_000_026","Precisely. And since we know the court thaumaturge was involved, we can safely assume that any entrance into the old city will have been magically concealed."
