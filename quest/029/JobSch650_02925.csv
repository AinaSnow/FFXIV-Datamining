1,"TEXT_JOBSCH650_02925_SEQ_01","As Setoto appears to be fully recovered, Alka Zolka would like to begin the search for a memento of her father. The Royal Marine suggests beginning at Amdapor Keep. If, as you have come to suspect, Setoto's father was captured by the Amdapori while on a mission to discover a way to reverse the Nymian plague, he would have been transported to Amdapor Keep for questioning. It is then likely that some of his remaining possessions can be found there. Make your way to the ancient ruins and look for any items which Setoto might remember her father by."
2,"TEXT_JOBSCH650_02925_SEQ_02","The three of you pick your way through Amdapor Keep, and you encounter various denizens of the ruins and ancient artifacts─including an Amdapori journal which touches upon taking a Nymian spy captive. From it you are able to conclude that Setoto's father's personal effects have been stored in a mana idol. As you begin dismantling these Amdapori golems, you are confronted by a manasnatcher, one of the hulking creatures that resides there. After a hard-fought battle, it falls lifeless to the ground, and a coffer tumbles from its innards. You, Alka, and Setoto move to open it."
3,"TEXT_JOBSCH650_02925_SEQ_03","You open it to see that it contains what appears to be Setoto's father's grimoire, clothes, and soul crystal. Gingerly taking the crystal in her hands, Setoto begs her father's faerie, Lilac, to appear. It unleashes a sphere of purple light and Setoto falls to the ground, unconscious. After an unsuccessful attempt to wake her, Alka Zolka bids you help him transport the tonberry out of the dangerous ruins and to Camp Tranquil."
4,"TEXT_JOBSCH650_02925_SEQ_04","You and Alka return to Camp Tranquil with Setoto, and the marauder asks that you use your knowledge to diagnose what is wrong with her. You conclude that, despite the lack of physical injuries, it will be a while before the young tonberry girl wakes. Alka is deeply troubled by the news, and his panicked shouts draw the attention of Landenel of the Wood Wailers, who offers to take Setoto into his care until such a time she has recovered. Requesting that you remain behind with her and Landenel, Alka Zolka leaves you for Bronze Lake to speak with Surito Carito.

※The next scholar quest will be available from Alka Zolka upon reaching level 68."

51,"TEXT_JOBSCH650_02925_ALKAZOLKA_000_004","Setoto's father was a scholar in the Royal Marines who had been dispatched on a mission to infiltrate Amdapor. He was to return with a cure to the disease that threatened to engulf Nym─only, he never did."
52,"TEXT_JOBSCH650_02925_SETOTO_000_005","Yes. I am almost certain he was caught, captured, and then killed by the Amdapori..."
53,"TEXT_JOBSCH650_02925_SETOTO_000_006","Even if that was not the case, after fifteen hundred years, we can safely assume he is no longer alive. I hold out hope, however, that some of his belongings remain."
54,"TEXT_JOBSCH650_02925_ALKAZOLKA_000_007","The Amdapori were extremely dedicated to expanding their knowledge of healing magic. Anything in a scholar's possession would have been of incredible value to them, and had your father been captured, they would have confiscated all that he had."
55,"TEXT_JOBSCH650_02925_ALKAZOLKA_000_008","He would then likely have been transported to a remote and secure location for interrogation. That means... "
56,"TEXT_JOBSCH650_02925_ALKAZOLKA_000_009","Our chances of finding anything that once belonged to him will be highest in Amdapor Keep."
57,"TEXT_JOBSCH650_02925_SETOTO_000_010","Oh, Alka, not only are you terribly kind, but you are keen of mind, as well!"
58,"TEXT_JOBSCH650_02925_ALKAZOLKA_000_011","Ahem. Thank you. Now, in the final years of the War of the Magi, Amdapor was demolished by the Mhachi. It was overrun with a myriad of voidsent beasts that linger to this day."
