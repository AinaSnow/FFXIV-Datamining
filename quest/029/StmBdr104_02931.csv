0,"TEXT_STMBDR104_02931_SEQ_00","Cid looks expectantly in your direction."
1,"TEXT_STMBDR104_02931_SEQ_01","With Biggs and Wedge not expected to report back for some time, Cid proposes that you move ahead with the tests. Your next opponent, Delta III, is apparently a being known as Halicarnassus, which Nero reveals to be the antagonist from a tale dating back to the Fourth Astral Era. Hearing this, Cid expresses surprise at the thought that Omega is deriving its subjects from works of fiction, at which moment Midgardsormr manifests to provide some timely insight. Omega, the Father of Dragons explains, has no soul and is therefore incapable of imagination; be it from fact or fiction, it must draw upon historic material in order to create. While the revelation excites Nero, it gives Cid a moment's pause, but he sets his questions aside in favor of focusing on the task at hand: defeating Halicarnassus. As has now become traditional, Alpha is waiting patiently for your signal to proceed.

※In the event that you leave the Interdimensional Rift, you may re-enter by speaking with the Ironworks hand at the Yawn."
2,"TEXT_STMBDR104_02931_SEQ_02","Alpha kwehs to you his readiness to enter the Deltascape. Once your own preparations are in order, you may step through the portal to do battle with Halicarnassus.

※Deltascape V3.0 can be accessed via the Duty Finder."
3,"TEXT_STMBDR104_02931_SEQ_03","In the Deltascape, you confront Halicarnassus, the flamboyant and formidable Queen of Dimension Castle. Yet all her pomp and pageantry avails her naught as you succeed in dethroning her, your victory and her demise a recreation of the ages-old tale."
4,"TEXT_STMBDR104_02931_SEQ_04","With each new foe more dangerous than the last, Cid seems especially glad of your safe return. Thanks to your tireless efforts, but one test subject remains in the Deltascape. Take what rest you may, lest your next encounter prove a battle too far."

54,"TEXT_STMBDR104_02931_CID_000_012","According to the analysis, your next opponent, Delta III, is a being named Halicarnassus."
55,"TEXT_STMBDR104_02931_NERO_000_013","Halicarnassus, you say? The Queen of Dimension Castle?"

57,"TEXT_STMBDR104_02931_NERO_000_015","You mean you don't? Well, I suppose a blue-blooded brat such as you would have no interest in humble folktales."
58,"TEXT_STMBDR104_02931_NERO_000_016","<sigh> It appears a lesson is in order. Halicarnassus is a character from an ancient fable. In the tale, she is one of the chief antagonists, and as such things are wont to unfold, she meets her end at the hands of the heroes─incurably valiant youths not unlike our adventurer friend here."
59,"TEXT_STMBDR104_02931_NERO_000_017","Literary historians have speculated that the tale could be loosely based on events which took place in the Fourth Astral Era, but little remains of that age, and there is no way to verify the claim. Indeed, most now assume the story to be a work of pure fiction."

70,"TEXT_STMBDR104_02931_CID_000_028","...But mayhap now is not the time. <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> said <If(PlayerParameter(4))>she<Else/>he</If> was ready to continue, and so am I. Let's deal with Halicarnassus."
