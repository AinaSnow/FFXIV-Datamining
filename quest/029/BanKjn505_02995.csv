49,"TEXT_BANKJN505_02995_ZUKIN_000_001","One of our craftsmen has gone to open up the shells and gather the contents on-site. However, diamond oysters are notoriously hard to open, so perhaps he would benefit from an extra pair of hands?"

51,"TEXT_BANKJN505_02995_KAISURI02995_000_011","I'm after the mother of pearl inside those oysters, but the damned things won't open! Hard as diamonds they are! They certainly live up to their name. I've tried prising them apart, dropping rocks on them, but no joy. "
52,"TEXT_BANKJN505_02995_KAISURI02995_000_012","The only thing I haven't tried is explosives. A bit of gentle persuasion, and they should pop right open! I hate to admit it, but I'm scared I might do myself a mischief. I don't suppose you could give it a try?"

55,"TEXT_BANKJN505_02995_KAISURI02995_000_020","Nicely done! The oysters are a bit more “obliterated” than I would've liked, but fragments of mother of pearl are better than nothing at all. Many thanks!"
