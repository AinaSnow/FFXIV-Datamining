※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANKJN002_02974_SEQ_01","Kabuto approaches you in hushed tones about his first expedition. When he fails to state anything beyond the obvious─that they will soon be departing─Tsukumo takes it upon himself to better inform you of their plan. As he tells it, they recently received word of a promising addition to the vault somewhere near Namai in Yanxia. With no other leads, Tsukumo skips away with Kabuto in tow.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANKJN002_02974_SEQ_02","You speak with a villager in Namai who tells you of a Namazu sneaking about the Glittering Basin with what people assume to be treasure. Though Tsukumo believes your time would be better spent learning more about the Namazu, Kabuto insists on commencing a search for this elusive figure so as not to waste any more of your time. Tsukumo is equal parts surprised and impressed by this sudden assertiveness and eventually concedes. Your next course of action is decided, and so you make for the Glittering Basin."
3,"TEXT_BANKJN002_02974_SEQ_03","You find Kabuto overlooking the basin from an ideal vantage point. As he checks the north, you begin a survey of the south when a curious shape comes into view. No sooner do you realize the figure is a Namazu than it darts back out of sight."
4,"TEXT_BANKJN002_02974_SEQ_04","Along the shoreline you discover not only the Namazu, but the treasure it carefully guards: a vase. Before you can approach, however, the Namazu is confronted by a band of Red Kojin. Tsukumo and Kabuto waste no time in rushing down to save both the Namazu and its treasure. "
5,"TEXT_BANKJN002_02974_SEQ_05","By the time you arrive, the vase is already in the clutches of the Red Kojin. When Kabuto refuses to back down, they choose to flee rather than fight. Kabuto gives chase, but he will likely need your help when he catches up with them."
6,"TEXT_BANKJN002_02974_SEQ_06","You find Kabuto to the north, three Red Kojin fallen at his feet. Despite Hirumaki making off with the vase, Gyokei is oddly relieved. As he explains it, the vase was cursed to bring misfortune to its owner, and he was hard-pressed to find a way to break the curse or dispose of it. Gyokei readily agrees to become a trading partner with the Blue Kojin, and offers a chime from his storehouse as a token of good faith. Kabuto and Tsukumo then return to Tamamizu for a well-earned rest."
7,"TEXT_BANKJN002_02974_SEQ_07","Thanks to your efforts, the vault of Tamamizu has gained a treasure and the Blue Kojin a trading partner. While Kabuto thinks little of the part he has played thus far, Tsukumo has every confidence that he will lead his band of treasure seekers to ever greater riches."
