82,"TEXT_FESSUM305_02960_GEGERUJU_000_096","It is one thing to attend the festivities and applaud the Miqo'te's lovely dances. It is another thing altogether to keep vigil over their beauty from afar. I certainly am glad I chose to leave things to you this year, Jiriri."
83,"TEXT_FESSUM305_02960_JIRIRI_000_097","Your praise means much. I daresay the faire would never have grown so lively had we not spread the rumors of a hidden treasure."
84,"TEXT_FESSUM305_02960_JIRIRI_000_098","Come, Gegeruju. There are other places from which we must enjoy the view. It will not serve to linger too long in any one place, lest we be discovered. Therein lies all the fun, does it not?"
85,"TEXT_FESSUM305_02960_GEGERUJU_000_099","Right you are! Let us away, then. There are countless other scantily clad Miqo'te being deprived of my watchful eye!"
86,"TEXT_FESSUM305_02960_HAERMAGA_000_100","Well, things have gotten...interesting. Let us return and consider how best to deal with all this."
87,"TEXT_FESSUM305_02960_HAERMAGA_000_110","So, it would seem the rumors of treasure were started by Jiriri in an attempt to fulfill Gegeruju's...desires. To think, this whole thing was a farce spun up by their perverse little minds."
88,"TEXT_FESSUM305_02960_HAERMAGA_000_111","Very well, this is how it will be. If any trouble is born of this treasure nonsense, those two will answer for it. "
89,"TEXT_FESSUM305_02960_HAERMAGA_000_112","As for the faire, so long as the Bombards stay away, we've no need of adventurers' might. But we do have need of your aid."
