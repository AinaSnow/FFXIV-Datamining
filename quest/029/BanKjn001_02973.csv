Mistaking you for a threat, the Blue Kojin prepares to fight, but soon lowers his blade as you explain why you have come. The maiden before you is, in fact, Shihoumi, and she tells of the Blue Kojin's daring rescue. Though gravely injured, he soon runs off to retrieve Shihoumi's stolen cargo from the Red Kojin. She begs you to save him from this fool's errand before it is too late."

Moreover, you have been named his first recruit. Never one to decline a call to action, you prepare yourself for adventures both wondrous and perilous."
