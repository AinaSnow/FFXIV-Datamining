49,"TEXT_BANKJN405_02989_ZUKIN_000_001","Most of the creatures there will only turn to attack if we draw too close. However, the analas go to great lengths to hunt us down. Their ferocity is known throughout the Ruby Sea."
50,"TEXT_BANKJN405_02989_ZUKIN_000_002","It is to you we must turn. Venture into their territory, slay any that confront you. A show of force should send the rest slinking back to their dens."

52,"TEXT_BANKJN405_02989_ZUKIN_000_020","Glad tidings indeed. By your account, we have the shores of Hells' Lid to ourselves again. The area is safe for harvesting shellfish, for the time being at least."
53,"TEXT_BANKJN405_02989_ZUKIN_000_021","Not only are they good for eating, but they are also used in the production of mother of pearl-inlaid pots. The Namazu gladly pay large sums for them, only to jump inside and stay there for hours on end."
54,"TEXT_BANKJN405_02989_ZUKIN_000_022","Why? Perhaps the kami know, but I do not. I do know, however, that the analas will not be content to remain in their lairs like the Namazu in their pots. Should they emerge once more, we may require your aid."
