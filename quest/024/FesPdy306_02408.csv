The ever-eager royal seneschal, however, wishes to get in a few last words with you and the girls before the show begins.

3,"TEXT_FESPDY306_02408_SEQ_03","The end of the Songbirds' concert has taken a great load off the royal seneschal's shoulders, and he thanks you profusely for your help in ensuring its success. As a token of his gratitude, he presents you with a small stack of vouchers that can be exchanged for a variety of Little Ladies' Day goods, including replicas of the Songbirds' costume─for ladies and gentlemen both. Bidding you enjoy the rest of the festival, he reminds you that the trio of preteen troubadours will continue performing throughout the event, and urges you to drop by to see them, should the fancy strike you."
