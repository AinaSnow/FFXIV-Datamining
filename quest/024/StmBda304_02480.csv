68,"TEXT_STMBDA304_02480_TANSUI_000_066","At the risk of repeating myself, to join the Confederacy is to renounce all other ties. We are beholden to none─allied with none."

You are free to come and go as you please, but you will receive no further aid."

85,"TEXT_STMBDA304_02480_ALISAIE_000_110","Such unusual designs. Unlike the standards of most nations and organizations, they have chosen to incorporate a variety of symbols. A testament to their diverse heritage?"
86,"TEXT_STMBDA304_02480_LYSE_000_115","They've got plenty to eat, by the look of it, though it's mostly the same stuff. I wonder if they trade much with outsiders..."

88,"TEXT_STMBDA304_02480_SYSTEM_000_125","A number of crates and barrels have been stored here. On closer inspection, however, most are empty..."
89,"TEXT_STMBDA304_02480_NAWASHIRO_000_130","Hm? Taken an interest in the ship? Heh, good eye! She's not much to look at now, but once upon a time, she was a beauty!"
90,"TEXT_STMBDA304_02480_NAWASHIRO_000_131","The Confederacy favors flotillas of smaller ships to capture and board errant vessels. The larger ones, like this sekibune, only take part in major engagements."
91,"TEXT_STMBDA304_02480_NAWASHIRO_000_132","...Not that we've had any of those recently, what with those imperial bastards throwing their weight around. If it wasn't for them... Well, no use moaning about what you can't change, eh?"
92,"TEXT_STMBDA304_02480_NAWASHIRO_000_135","She's less a ship and more a storehouse these days. What a waste..."
93,"TEXT_STMBDA304_02480_ALISAIE_000_140","Had a good look around? Then we just need to wait for Lyse."
94,"TEXT_STMBDA304_02480_LYSE_000_141","Sorry to keep you waiting, but I wanted to talk to as many people as I could..."
95,"TEXT_STMBDA304_02480_LYSE_000_142","It's just as Tansui said. They have no intention of standing up to Yotsuyu."
96,"TEXT_STMBDA304_02480_LYSE_000_143","I don't know if you two got a different impression..."

100,"TEXT_STMBDA304_02480_ALISAIE_000_147","I agree. It's obvious that they are struggling to survive, and that they blame the imperials for their recent troubles."
101,"TEXT_STMBDA304_02480_ALISAIE_000_148","Even if we do nothing, it is inevitable that they will come into conflict with the Empire sooner or later─and deep down, they all know it."
102,"TEXT_STMBDA304_02480_ALISAIE_000_149","The only thing holding them back at the moment is the belief that they lack the strength to survive the coming war."
103,"TEXT_STMBDA304_02480_LYSE_000_150","So we need to prove to them that we're not all talk─that we can be valuable allies in the fight!"
104,"TEXT_STMBDA304_02480_ALISAIE_000_151","And what better way to demonstrate our worth than by...seeking out people with mundane problems and offering them our expert assistance?"
105,"TEXT_STMBDA304_02480_LYSE_000_152","Wouldn't be the first time we've had to earn someone's trust by helping them out with this and that. And you know it won't be the last."
106,"TEXT_STMBDA304_02480_LYSE_000_153","I'll look around the western end of Onokoro. You two take the east. Good luck!"
