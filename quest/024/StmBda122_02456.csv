51,"TEXT_STMBDA122_02456_MEFFRID_000_012","Greetings and well met, elder, and sincerest apologies that I did not send word ahead of our arrival. Too long have I been away from Ala Gannha, and I would know of your recent troubles."
52,"TEXT_STMBDA122_02456_RAGANFRID_000_013","Ah, you are comrades of Meffrid. I see, I see..."

54,"TEXT_STMBDA122_02456_MEFFRID_000_014","The Griffin came with many men, and left with many more. Such is the rumor. Is it true?"
55,"TEXT_STMBDA122_02456_RAGANFRID_000_015","He lit a fire in their hearts and then dangled a dream before their tired eyes. And now you come to steal away what few remain."
56,"TEXT_STMBDA122_02456_MEFFRID_000_016","The Griffin was a traitor and a madman, and we had no part in his schemes. We have made an agreement with the Alliance─this time it will be different!"
57,"TEXT_STMBDA122_02456_RAGANFRID_000_017","This time? This time!? Cold comfort to the dead and the ones they left behind! How much more must we give before you've had your fill?"

60,"TEXT_STMBDA122_02456_RAGANFRID_000_020","But hate's not enough, Meffrid. I can't...we can't keep doing this. I'll not tell anyone you came, but you need to go. Now. Leave us be, and never return."
61,"TEXT_STMBDA122_02456_LYSE_000_021","You've got no right to speak to us like that─"
62,"TEXT_STMBDA122_02456_RAGANFRID_000_022","I've got a quarry that was producing barely enough to keep us fed, and that was before half our young men and women went off to die for your bloody cause!"
63,"TEXT_STMBDA122_02456_RAGANFRID_100_022","So yes, I've got every right to tell you to leave my village!"

69,"TEXT_STMBDA122_02456_LYSE_000_027","I almost didn't. And my sister never will. Lots of others won't either...and that's why we've got to carry on the fight."
70,"TEXT_STMBDA122_02456_RAGANFRID_000_028","You even sound like him... <sigh> As you say, I've got no right to tell you to leave. Ala Gannha is as much your home as it is mine."
71,"TEXT_STMBDA122_02456_RAGANFRID_100_028","But I say to you again: we can give no more."

75,"TEXT_STMBDA122_02456_MEFFRID_000_040","That could've been handled better, but what's done is done. At least we've been granted permission to stay."
76,"TEXT_STMBDA122_02456_RAGANFRID_000_050","Do what you will and say what you like─you'll find no recruits here."

78,"TEXT_STMBDA122_02456_MEFFRID_000_061","It's risky, and it's hardly subtle, but I say we approach the villagers directly─see what problems they've got, and if we can do anything to help."
79,"TEXT_STMBDA122_02456_LYSE_000_062","Makes sense to me. Let's split up and ask around."
