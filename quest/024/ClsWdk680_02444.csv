While she seems to be enjoying her stay there, a great portion of what she writes is dedicated to food. Perhaps it would be best if you were to depart for Namai posthaste and remind her of the purpose of her journey there─to continue her studies on oriental furniture."

As the Garleans' grip on the lands weaken, he is looking to fulfill his lifelong dream of opening a restaurant. With limited funds, however, it has been difficult for him to acquire the furniture he needs. Cemi jumps at the chance to volunteer, adding that she would like to turn this into a competition between you and her to see who can better satisfy the client. Reizan does not oppose the idea, and requests that you make something to accommodate the dining habits of both enclave and country folk. To determine exactly what that might be, he suggests you speak with the local residents."
4,"TEXT_CLSWDK680_02444_SEQ_04","Upon speaking with the nearby citizens, you learn that people from the enclave will only dine in a private setting, as they consider it rude to do so before strangers.

5,"TEXT_CLSWDK680_02444_SEQ_05","Upon hearing that you intend to craft partitions, Cemi begins hurling accusations at you, convinced that you would never deign to create anything that simple unless you were attempting to lose on purpose. A simple explanation quickly calms her, and she apologizes. Handing you the materials you may need, she leaves you to make high-quality ornate partitions for Reizan.

The chef declares that from the first moment, he knew your creation was the one he preferred, as it fulfills his request for something that would allow both enclave and country folk to dine in comfort. The competition now over, Beatin bids both you and Cemi return to Gridania."
7,"TEXT_CLSWDK680_02444_SEQ_07","Over the course of her studies in the Far East, Cemi has come to realize the importance of listening to her clients and adapting her furniture to suit their wants and needs. Having this most important of lessons firmly instilled within her, Timbermaster Beatin is confident that she will become a better carpenter for it. He thanks you for inspiring his young apprentice and asks you to speak with her one last time before you leave."
8,"TEXT_CLSWDK680_02444_SEQ_08","Cemi excitedly tells you that the timbermaster has deemed her worthy of taking on clients. While fulfilling commissions, she also plans to continue practicing making oriental furniture so as not to forget all that she learned during her stay in the Far East. It seems she looks up to you a great deal and hopes that she will one day become a master carpenter like you.
