1,"TEXT_FESEST303_02423_SEQ_01","A rock-riding spriggan, unknown to and unendorsed by Hatching–tide organizers, has taken to startling folk in the forest. The creature was last seen making for the city; should it cause a commotion there, the blame is like to fall upon the festival. Nonotta bids you return with her to Gridania in order to alert Jihli at Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre.

From what you can make of his limited vocabulary, the creature was merely mimicking your actions in hopes of making people happy. Jihli invites Riggy to be an official part of the festival, and together they head back to Hyrstmill. Make your own way there and speak with Nonotta to learn what manner of plans they have in store."

9,"TEXT_FESEST303_02423_SEQ_09","You show Nonotta your haul of shock eggs, after which Riggy arrives with other festival helpers in tow. Reflecting upon recent events, Jihli experiences an epiphany: the gemstone in her dream is none other than Riggy, who rode atop his magnificent rock and spread dazzling smiles to those around him. Grateful for your part in making her vision a reality, she spontaneously decides to gift you the eggshilaration system. Loath to part with her creation, Nonotta inadvertently reveals its secret, but much to her surprise, the truth impresses rather than upsets Jihli. After a tender moment, she undergoes a change of heart and gives you her blessing to be the proud owner of a hovering egg. May it bear you to all you have ever dreamed."
