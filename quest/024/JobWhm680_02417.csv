Fearing that the two have fled the guildmaster's approach only to invite further disaster, you rush off in pursuit. Travel north, and search the shallows of the Velodyna River."

5,"TEXT_JOBWHM680_02417_SEQ_05","Sylphie is delighted by the guildmaster's decision, and thanks you for the part you've played in allowing Gatty to remain with her mother. But there is still much work to be done before the girl learns complete control over her aether─show Gatty a good example, and continue to improve upon your own skills.
