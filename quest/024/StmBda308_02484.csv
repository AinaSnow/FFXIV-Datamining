1,"TEXT_STMBDA308_02484_SEQ_01","The requisite items have been gathered and given to Soroban, and so he invites you to join him at the western edge of Tamamizu. There, where the water twists and turns on the surface of the dome, he will perform the ritual to let you traverse the depths as easily as any Kojin, that you might begin your search for the Yasakani–no–Magatama."
2,"TEXT_STMBDA308_02484_SEQ_02","The deep, booming voice of Soroban resounds in your ears as he intones a sacred prayer to the kami of the deep. With a flash of light, it is done, and you are told you can breathe underwater as you would on land. Alisaie's skepticism turns to amazement once she passes through the portal and finds herself in open water, completely at ease. Yet that is not all, for Soroban then summons for you noble steeds of great strength. And so, with the aid of the striped rays, you embark on your journey to Sui–no–Sato."
3,"TEXT_STMBDA308_02484_SEQ_03","It is not long before you arrive at your destination─the underwater village of the Raen. But will these reclusive people be willing to aid your cause?"
