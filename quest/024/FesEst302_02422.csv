2,"TEXT_FESEST302_02422_SEQ_02","Motte gives you a rundown of the eggshilaration system's functionality, namely how to launch the shockobo. Hop on the egg now and use the shockobo on Nonotta.

Unfortunately, that effect was lost on Jihli, a result which has left Nonotta disheartened. For now, do your part in the festivities by seeking out three festival participants in the Twelveswood and startling them with the shockobo. Once you have three shock eggs for your troubles, deliver them to Nonotta.

※Speak with Motte at Hyrstmill to ride the eggshilaration system."

5,"TEXT_FESEST302_02422_SEQ_05","No sooner do you hand Nonotta the eggs than the three people you received them from come running up. In excited and appreciative tones, they tell of a rock-riding spriggan that gave them the shock of their lives. The news leaves Nonotta puzzled and perturbed, as spriggans aren't part of the plan.
