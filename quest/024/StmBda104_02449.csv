69,"TEXT_STMBDA104_02449_LYSE_000_073","Well, one of the smaller factions has. The rest won't have anything to do with us. We're no different from the Garleans to them."
70,"TEXT_STMBDA104_02449_LYSE_000_074","They keep to themselves, spending all their time crafting. Ananta make the most amazing jewelry, by the way. They use magicks to twist metals and crystal into shapes you wouldn't believe. It's a pity people hardly ever get to see their work. But then most don't even know they exist."
71,"TEXT_STMBDA104_02449_LYSE_000_075","That's enough about them, anyway. Let's take a closer look at the statue of Rhalgr, shall we?"
72,"TEXT_STMBDA104_02449_LYSE_000_080","When you've seen one aetheryte, you've seen them all, right? Not quite. This one's an older design, dating back decades, to when the Fist of Rhalgr was still here."

Hells open, Heavens weep.
For no one soul doth lie beyond
The measure of His Reach.”"

85,"TEXT_STMBDA104_02449_LYSE_000_110","Arms, armor, potions─you name it, these folks've got it. The Resistance would be in a bad way without brave merchants to keep it provisioned."
