78,"TEXT_STMBDA302_02478_SOROBAN_000_100","Oh, my friends! A thousand pardons! ...As you may have guessed, I was reluctant to be seen in your company by my Red brothers. Ours is a...complex relationship."

80,"TEXT_STMBDA302_02478_SOROBAN_000_102","You...you understand? Kami be praised! Too often are shell-less quick to judge all Kojin for the deeds of one."
