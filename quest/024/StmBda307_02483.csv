52,"TEXT_STMBDA307_02483_SOROBAN_000_012","Very well. I shall introduce you to our leader, Bunchin. It will be up to you, however, to present your case."
53,"TEXT_STMBDA307_02483_LYSE_000_020","Um, should we bow when we meet the elder? I know that's the sort of thing they usually do in the Far East, but does that extend to turtle people living under the sea? Oh, why must diplomacy be so complicated..."
54,"TEXT_STMBDA307_02483_ALISAIE_000_025","The center of the village lies further below. I still have so many questions, but they will have to wait. The elder awaits."
55,"TEXT_STMBDA307_02483_SOROBAN_000_030","I present to you the honored elder Bunchin.
(...You should probably refrain from addressing him by name. He does not much care for it.)"
56,"TEXT_STMBDA307_02483_LYSE_000_040","Whatever it is we've got to do, we'll do it, right? I mean, what other choice do we have?"

59,"TEXT_STMBDA307_02483_SOROBAN_000_060","Listen well, my friends. We require your assistance with the search for a priceless treasure: the Yasakani–no–Magatama."
60,"TEXT_STMBDA307_02483_SOROBAN_000_061","This jewel, this most sacred of Kojin relics, was in the possession of Hingashi─until they decided to present it to the Garleans in a gesture of conciliation."
61,"TEXT_STMBDA307_02483_SOROBAN_000_062","The Red would not abide this, and so they plotted to seize the vessel bearing it to their imperial masters. Alas, though they succeeded, in the ensuing chaos the Magatama was lost to the sea."
62,"TEXT_STMBDA307_02483_SOROBAN_000_063","We wish to recover the sacred jewel before our brothers. However, were we to come into conflict with them, it would be...problematic. Therefore, we turn to you."
63,"TEXT_STMBDA307_02483_LYSE_000_064","So you want us to search the ocean floor for this treasure of yours? I'm not sure how we're supposed to do that without, you know..."
64,"TEXT_STMBDA307_02483_SOROBAN_000_065","Drowning? Fear not. There is a ritual I can perform to imbue your bodies with a powerful blessing. But first, you must prepare offerings for the sea."
65,"TEXT_STMBDA307_02483_SOROBAN_000_066","I require twisted ruby coral, several fist-sized sea snail shells, and a freshly harvested unkiu carapace."
66,"TEXT_STMBDA307_02483_ALISAIE_000_067","That's quite the shopping list. I will see to the shells, and Lyse can look for the coral. <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, would you go and find an unkiu and relieve it of its carapace?"
67,"TEXT_STMBDA307_02483_LYSE_000_070","I think I see some ruby coral over there. It's a bit far, but I can swim for it."
68,"TEXT_STMBDA307_02483_ALISAIE_000_075","How quick my dearest brother was to boast of his firewood gathering techniques. If only he were here to gather these shells in my stead..."
69,"TEXT_STMBDA307_02483_SOROBAN_000_080","Do take care when killing the unkiu not to damage its carapace too much!"
70,"TEXT_STMBDA307_02483_SOROBAN_000_090","Well? Have you the unkiu carapace?"
71,"TEXT_STMBDA307_02483_SOROBAN_000_091","How splendid they are! The kami shall be most pleased, I am sure."
72,"TEXT_STMBDA307_02483_LYSE_000_092","I got it! I got the ruby coral you wanted!"
73,"TEXT_STMBDA307_02483_ALISAIE_000_093","And I the sea snail shells. They're about the size of my fist, though I realize now you may have meant yours..."
74,"TEXT_STMBDA307_02483_SOROBAN_000_094","These shall more than suffice for our purpose. Next, we must make ready to present them to the sea and perform the ritual."
75,"TEXT_STMBDA307_02483_SOROBAN_000_095","Once it has been completed, you will be able to move freely through the depths and find the Yasakani–no–Magatama!"
76,"TEXT_STMBDA307_02483_ALISAIE_000_096","...Out of curiosity, how large is this sacred jewel of yours? Unless it's far too large to be carried by the three of us, how are we supposed to even find it? The Ruby Sea is not exactly small."
77,"TEXT_STMBDA307_02483_SOROBAN_000_097","Hah hah hah! Surely you realize we have been searching this whole time? The area we wish you to explore is but a small fraction of the Ruby Sea."
78,"TEXT_STMBDA307_02483_SOROBAN_000_098","Already have we scoured most of the seabed near and within our territory, to no avail. All that remains is a region to the west."
79,"TEXT_STMBDA307_02483_SOROBAN_000_099","The shell-less of Sui–no–Sato can provide you with better guidance than we. You would do well to visit them first."
80,"TEXT_STMBDA307_02483_LYSE_000_100","Shell-less? You mean the Kojin aren't the only ones living under the sea?"
81,"TEXT_STMBDA307_02483_SOROBAN_000_101","Of course not! The Raen have been here as long as I can remember. Shiosai, the...overseer, I believe, can tell you more when you arrive."
82,"TEXT_STMBDA307_02483_SOROBAN_000_102","But we are getting ahead of ourselves. We have yet to carry out the ritual!"
