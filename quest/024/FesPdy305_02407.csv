0,"TEXT_FESPDY305_02407_SEQ_00","Narumi appears surprised to see you.
※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESPDY305_02407_SEQ_01","Narumi, while initially terrified at the thought of being the center of attention, quickly comes to realize that leading the group may be the perfect opportunity to help her overcome her indecisiveness─a habit which lands her in hot water from time to time. Promising to give their performance her all, she then rushes off to see to some last-minute preparations. Your job, however, is still far from done, as there is one last person who must be informed of your decision. Make your way back to the Ruby Road Exchange and let the royal seneschal know your Songbird of choice.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESPDY305_02407_SEQ_02","The royal seneschal is delighted when he hears that you chose Narumi to star in the upcoming show and is just as excited to inform you that Redolent Rose has made good upon his promise. Having received the girls' costumes while you were away, he tells you that they are every bit as glamorous as he had hoped they would be."

54,"TEXT_FESPDY305_02407_NARUMI_000_003","Ah, there I go again, questioning my own ability. <sigh> It's the same sort of self-doubt that landed me in trouble at Horizon earlier."

60,"TEXT_FESPDY305_02407_BUTLER_000_011","Narumi? Indeed, you make a convincing case. Her gentle demeanor and soft voice will warm the audience to their very cores, and they'll go home feeling as though they caught a glimpse into the heavens themselves!"
61,"TEXT_FESPDY305_02407_BUTLER_000_012","And speaking of heaven, while you were out speaking with Narumi, Redolent Rose came by with a very special delivery. You guessed it! The girls' costumes have finally arrived and they're absolutely divine!"
