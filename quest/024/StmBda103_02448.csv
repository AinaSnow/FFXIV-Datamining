Together they would expel the imperial presence from Gyr Abania─or as Conrad wryly puts it, “engage them by proxy” with the vastly inferior forces of the Resistance. In any event, such weighty decisions cannot be made lightly, and the commander and his officers will need time to reach a consensus."
