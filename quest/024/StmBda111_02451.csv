0,"TEXT_STMBDA111_02451_SEQ_00","Before she tells you of her mission, M'naago has a few things she would like to say."
1,"TEXT_STMBDA111_02451_SEQ_01","After thanking the Scions for nursing her back to health, M'naago explains that she has been tasked with delivering Commander Kemp's formal reply to General Aldynn. Given the importance of this mission, she requests that you escort her to Castrum Oriens, prompting Alisaie to volunteer as well."
2,"TEXT_STMBDA111_02451_SEQ_02","Having put your affairs in order, you leave Rhalgr's Reach with M'naago and Alisaie. If the gods are good, your journey through the Fringes should be quick and uneventful..."
3,"TEXT_STMBDA111_02451_SEQ_03","Gesturing for you and Alisaie to halt, M'naago informs you that she heard a ceruleum engine backfiring─a sure sign that an imperial patrol is close by. The three of you duly split up, hoping to take your enemies by surprise, and prevent them from summoning reinforcements."
4,"TEXT_STMBDA111_02451_SEQ_04","You ambush and destroy the magitek armor M'naago overheard. Though you have no reason to believe that your comrades fared any differently, you cannot be certain until you rejoin them."
5,"TEXT_STMBDA111_02451_SEQ_05","As expected, you find your comrades none the worse for wear. M'naago tells you that most soldiers in Gyr Abania are conscripts from other provinces. Poorly trained and lacking in morale, they rarely pose a threat in small numbers. Nevertheless, she cautions you against pitying them, as they are just as capable of killing your comrades as more motivated foes."

53,"TEXT_STMBDA111_02451_MNAAGO_000_021","Furthermore, it was rude of me to run off without saying a word. It's all well and good me claiming my duties here couldn't wait, but a parting thank-you was the very least you deserved. My apologies."

55,"TEXT_STMBDA111_02451_MNAAGO_000_023","Commander Kemp's entrusted me with a formal reply to be hand-delivered to the Alliance leadership. It covers everything we discussed, as well as detailing the disposition of our forces."
56,"TEXT_STMBDA111_02451_MNAAGO_000_024","What I need is an escort─one or two men at most, so we can make it to the Wall swiftly and without attracting undue attention."
57,"TEXT_STMBDA111_02451_ALISAIE_000_025","Very well. I shall join you in this."

From what I'm hearing...we have a seven-man patrol augmented with a single magitek armor. Wide search pattern. Divided into two─no, three teams. I don't think they know we're here..."
66,"TEXT_STMBDA111_02451_MNAAGO_000_063","It's risky, but we should split up and try to take them all by surprise at the same time. We don't want them calling reinforcements."

68,"TEXT_STMBDA111_02451_MNAAGO_000_065","Head north. You should see them long before they see you. I'll deal with the ones to the south. The armor should be just to the west─<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>'s best equipped to deal with that. We attack in five─that should be enough time to get into position. Rendezvous on the west bank after. Any questions? No? Then good luck!"
69,"TEXT_STMBDA111_02451_ALISAIE_000_070","I'm pleased to report that the Empire is short three soldiers─not that any self-respecting legatus would be sorry to lose them."
70,"TEXT_STMBDA111_02451_MNAAGO_000_080","It looks like everything went to plan. Not that I'm surprised─the three soldiers I faced didn't put up much of a fight."
71,"TEXT_STMBDA111_02451_MNAAGO_000_081","Most of the imperials we get out here are conscripts from other provinces with little training and even less conviction. It's grim work, killing men and women like that, but don't doubt that they'd do the same to you if the roles were reversed."
72,"TEXT_STMBDA111_02451_MNAAGO_000_082","And don't you <Emphasis>dare</Emphasis> pity a man in armor. Conscript or no, a soldier piloting one of those can kill a dozen good men in the blink of an eye. Not that I need to tell you that, after what happened at the Wall..."
