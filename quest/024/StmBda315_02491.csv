1,"TEXT_STMBDA315_02491_SEQ_01","Owing to the timely intervention of Confederate forces, Yotsuyu and her imperials have been driven from Isari, and their former captives managed to survive their ordeal. Despite his assurances, Gosetsu is clearly still troubled by the injuries he sustained from Grynewaht's brutal interrogation. Nevertheless, you decide to carry on and resume your journey to Yanxia."
2,"TEXT_STMBDA315_02491_SEQ_02","Life. Liberty. Hope. All this and more have the Garleans tried to take from the Domans. Everywhere you look you are confronted by evidence of the failed rebellion and the vicious reprisals which followed. Yet the imperial soldiers are conspicuous by their absence..."
3,"TEXT_STMBDA315_02491_SEQ_03","Zenos had no desire to remain in Doma after he crushed the rebellion, and so he named Yotsuyu to serve in his stead. The acting viceroy waged an indiscriminate campaign of terror, marching into villages without warning and committing unspeakable atrocities in the name of rooting out “radical elements.” After a time, these purges ceased, but the memory remains, and with it the promise of punishment should the people resist. And so there is little need for imperial patrols."
4,"TEXT_STMBDA315_02491_SEQ_04","Gosetsu leads you to Namai, a humble farming village a little ways to the west. Yet even though you see no signs of imperial soldiers, it would be exceedingly reckless to simply saunter into the village..."
