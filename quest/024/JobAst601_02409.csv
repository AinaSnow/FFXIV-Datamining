However, forces in both the Holy See and the island nation of scholars to the north would work to prevent her from accomplishing that very thing. Yet, with your aid and (to a far lesser extent) that of the nobleman Jannequinard de Durendaire, Leveva is able to thwart her enemies and open the door for bringing Ishgard into an all new era of astrological studies.
