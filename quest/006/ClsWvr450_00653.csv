1,"TEXT_CLSWVR450_00653_SEQ_01","Redolent Rose has decided that the best way to help Wawarukka is to ignore the miner's terrible taste in clothing. To that end, he has taken the liberty of changing Wawarukka's commission. Before you can proceed, you must first obtain approval from the miner. Speak with Wawarukka and obtain his permission."
2,"TEXT_CLSWVR450_00653_SEQ_02","While surprised by the guildmaster's proposal, Wawarukka is willing to accept it, acknowledging that his ignorance of fashion has been the cause of his previous failures. Craft a woolen beret, gown, and gaskins of the highest quality and present them to Redolent Rose."
3,"TEXT_CLSWVR450_00653_SEQ_03","During the fitting, a depressed Wawarukka reveals that he saw Kokomo in the company of a wealthy suitor not long ago. Convinced that all is lost, he flees the guild in a fit of despair, proclaiming himself unworthy of Kokomo's affections. Resigned, Redolent Rose states that if Wawarukka is determined to give up, then there is nothing either of you can do to help.

※The next weaver quest will be available from Redolent Rose upon reaching level 50."

49,"TEXT_CLSWVR450_00653_REDOLENTROSE_001","He came to me again with another ridiculous commission, and I was completely at a loss as to how to proceed. But then, a stroke of genius!"
50,"TEXT_CLSWVR450_00653_REDOLENTROSE_002","We simply change his order and dress him as we see fit!"
51,"TEXT_CLSWVR450_00653_REDOLENTROSE_003","If we ignore his terrible taste in clothing and give him a stylish outfit, Babawai will have no cause to chase him away, and he will finally have his chance to speak with Kokomo!"
52,"TEXT_CLSWVR450_00653_REDOLENTROSE_004","And I've just the outfit in mind for this occasion: a beret, gown, and gaskins, all made from the finest wool. I daresay he'll be a man reborn when we've finished!"
53,"TEXT_CLSWVR450_00653_REDOLENTROSE_005","Of course, it is necessary that we gain his approval before changing his commission like this, but I am confident that he will see the wisdom in my proposal."
54,"TEXT_CLSWVR450_00653_WAWARUKKA_010","Hm? <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? What're you doin' here? I already told Big Rose what I wanted this time."
55,"TEXT_CLSWVR450_00653_WAWARUKKA_011","Oh...he wants to change my order? Well, I s'pose that's alright."
56,"TEXT_CLSWVR450_00653_WAWARUKKA_012","I know I'm a fool when it comes to fashion an' all that. Seems I only make things worse when I try harder, too."
57,"TEXT_CLSWVR450_00653_WAWARUKKA_013","A woolen beret, gown, and gaskins, was it? Yeah, that sounds nice. I'll meet you there, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."
58,"TEXT_CLSWVR450_00653_WAWARUKKA_020","Well...I'm here. We doin' this or no?"

61,"TEXT_CLSWVR450_00653_REDOLENTROSE_041","I think we've outdone ourselves, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Just look at him standing there, a vision of grace and refinement!"

66,"TEXT_CLSWVR450_00653_WAWARUKKA_046","It's too late. On the way here, I saw her walkin' with this wealthy-lookin' fella. Just the two of 'em."

69,"TEXT_CLSWVR450_00653_WAWARUKKA_049","I was a fool to think she could care for someone like me! I'll <Emphasis>never</Emphasis> be part of her world!"
