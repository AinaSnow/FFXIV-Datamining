1,"TEXT_CLSGLD150_00614_SEQ_01","The guildmaster abruptly recalls that she had another commission to assign you─once again for Robert of the Sultansworn. Craft a pair of fang earrings and a brass gorget and present them to Serendipity for inspection."
2,"TEXT_CLSGLD150_00614_SEQ_02","Gigi somehow manages to praise your handiwork and deeply offend Serendipity. In any case, both the guildmaster and her assistant judge the items fit for delivery. Take them to Robert outside the Goldsmiths' Guild."

He apologizes for the misunderstanding, and mentions that he will be keeping his eye on you from now on. Return to the guildmaster and tell her that the commission is complete."
