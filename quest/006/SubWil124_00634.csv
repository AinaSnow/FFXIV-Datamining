52,"TEXT_SUBWIL124_00634_BENEGER_000_12","Now, you listen to me, you bloody rock! The Golden Bazaar is counting on you. If this talk of mythril turns out to be a farce, I swear by the Twelve I'll dig up every last pebble of you myself, grind you to powder, and sell you to the chocobo stables to sop up piss and runny shite!"
53,"TEXT_SUBWIL124_00634_BENEGER_000_13","Ahem... Yes, well, sorry about that. It's just that ever since the war saw the road to Ala Mhigo cut off, the Bazaar has fallen on tough times. It is a waypoint choked off from its way, and is now little more than a point."
54,"TEXT_SUBWIL124_00634_BENEGER_000_14","But I will not let it be so. I'm going to make the Golden Bazaar golden once more. From there, I'll become one of the richest men in Thanalan. Then I'll finally be able to give Caitlyn the life those mongrels stole from her."
