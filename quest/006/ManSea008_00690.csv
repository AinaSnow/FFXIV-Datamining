2,"TEXT_MANSEA008_00690_SEQ_02","It seems that your garb lacks the refinement expected of the guest of honor of a state banquet. Baderon tells you to visit J'nasshym at the Octant, and collect a “<If(PlayerParameter(4))>ladylike<Else/>gentlemanly</If>” addition to your wardrobe."
3,"TEXT_MANSEA008_00690_SEQ_03","J'nasshym has entrusted you with a raxa-lined box containing your <If(PlayerParameter(4))>“ladylike”<Else/>“gentlemanly”</If> apparel. Return to the Drowning Wench and show the package to Baderon."
4,"TEXT_MANSEA008_00690_SEQ_04","After handing the box over to Baderon, you discover that it holds a pair of expensive dress shoes. The Wench's proprietor explains that the footwear is a gift from him, and from all the people you have aided on your travels. Speak with Baderon again when you are ready to attend the banquet."
