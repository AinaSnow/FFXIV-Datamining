64,"TEXT_CLSMIN250_00605_ADALBERTA_000_24","I say this partly for your own good...and partly because the lad whose task you just took care of <Emphasis>wasn't</Emphasis> careful."

67,"TEXT_CLSMIN250_00605_ADALBERTA_000_29","Thankfully, you took up the slack, and all is well with the guild once more. I could do with a few more like you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Keep up the good work, you hear?"
