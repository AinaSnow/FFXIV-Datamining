1,"TEXT_SUBWIL114_00622_SEQ_01","Thancred has been searching for you, and bids you meet him near the Amalj'aa encampment to the southeast of Camp Drybone."
2,"TEXT_SUBWIL114_00622_SEQ_02","You meet Thancred outside the nearby Amalj'aa encampment. He asks that you enter and search for evidence of their involvement in the vanishings at Camp Drybone."
3,"TEXT_SUBWIL114_00622_SEQ_03","You have found a suspicious leaflet. Return to Thancred and show it to him."
4,"TEXT_SUBWIL114_00622_SEQ_04","The leaflet does not appear to have been written by a member of the Order. Show it to Sister Ourcen at the inn at Camp Drybone to see if she can provide any insight."
5,"TEXT_SUBWIL114_00622_SEQ_05","Sister Ourcen confirms that the leaflet is not of the Order's making, and goes on to tell you that the church was recently plagued by a rash of missing garments. Speak with Thancred to determine your next course of action."
6,"TEXT_SUBWIL114_00622_SEQ_06","Thancred believes it likely that the culprit behind the vanishings is posing as a priest of the Order. Warn Isembard of this potential danger."
7,"TEXT_SUBWIL114_00622_SEQ_07","Isembard resolves to stay vigilant in light of the new information. Thancred, meanwhile, has withdrawn to consider the situation more carefully. What course of action might the Sharlayan bard come up with?"

49,"TEXT_SUBWIL114_00622_ISEMBARD_000_2","But now, on to the matter at hand. Thancred came looking for you once more. He left word that he will be waiting at the Amalj'aa encampment to the southeast. I pray the two of you are able to uncover <Emphasis>some</Emphasis> evidence regarding these disappearances."
50,"TEXT_SUBWIL114_00622_THANCRED_000_10","Ah, there you are, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. So good of you to come!"
51,"TEXT_SUBWIL114_00622_THANCRED_000_11","Indeed, I've heard all about good Sister Ourcen. Isembard said her wounds were serious. It would seem my suspicions about the poor rose were misplaced."
52,"TEXT_SUBWIL114_00622_THANCRED_000_12","But false though they were, perhaps my suspicions were not entirely without merit. Whilst following Sister Ourcen near the Golden Bazaar, a band of Amalj'aa caught my eye."
53,"TEXT_SUBWIL114_00622_THANCRED_000_13","I tracked them as far as this encampment, but... Well, let us say that I would much prefer to keep my distance and remain here. This, of course, brings me to why I requested you, dear <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Would you be so kind as to take a look inside?"
54,"TEXT_SUBWIL114_00622_THANCRED_000_20","I'd much prefer to keep an eye on things from out here. Go and take a look about inside, would you?"
55,"TEXT_SUBWIL114_00622_THANCRED_000_30","Well? Did anything tickle your fancy?"
56,"TEXT_SUBWIL114_00622_THANCRED_000_31","This leaflet... “See the wealth of Nald to the hands of your children.” It looks to be some sort of assembly to provide the poor with work."
57,"TEXT_SUBWIL114_00622_THANCRED_000_32","The lettering, though... Atrocious, is it not? And these bits about Nald'thal seem somewhat...less than studied. I find it hard to believe one among the Order penned this."
58,"TEXT_SUBWIL114_00622_THANCRED_000_33","Pray take this to the inn at Camp Drybone. Let us see what Sister Ourcen makes of it."
59,"TEXT_SUBWIL114_00622_THANCRED_000_40","Now, let us see what Sister Ourcen makes of this leaflet."
60,"TEXT_SUBWIL114_00622_OURCEN_000_50","My savior comes again. To what do I owe the honor this day?"
61,"TEXT_SUBWIL114_00622_OURCEN_000_51","What is this? Blasphemous... These are not our teachings at all! This was not made by any <Emphasis>true</Emphasis> brother or sister of the Order─of <Emphasis>that</Emphasis>, I can assure you."
62,"TEXT_SUBWIL114_00622_OURCEN_000_52","Come to think of it, weeks ago, the church was plagued by missing garments. Could someone be posing as a priest of the Order to deceive the people?"
63,"TEXT_SUBWIL114_00622_OURCEN_000_60","Who would do such a thing?"
64,"TEXT_SUBWIL114_00622_THANCRED_000_70","The plot thickens, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Our culprit pretends to be a priest to lend credence to his deception. There is no doubt an irony in there somewhere."
65,"TEXT_SUBWIL114_00622_THANCRED_000_71","But I suspect we have a worthy adversary on our hands. I shall consider how best to handle this. For now, tell Isembard what we have learned here."
66,"TEXT_SUBWIL114_00622_ISEMBARD_000_80","Posing as a priest!? To think..."
67,"TEXT_SUBWIL114_00622_ISEMBARD_000_81","These troubling notions aside, it is gratifying to finally be able to move this investigation forward. Thank you once again, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I shall keep my ears and eyes open─now more than ever."
