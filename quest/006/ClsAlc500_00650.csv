1,"TEXT_CLSALC500_00650_SEQ_01","Severian explains that his previous attempt to resurrect his lost love failed to take into account the necessity for a spiritual anchor. Speak with W'bulea in Pearl Lane, and ask if she might spare the guildmaster an object that W'nahja held dear."
2,"TEXT_CLSALC500_00650_SEQ_02","W'bulea is unable─or unwilling─to give you any items that her sister might have treasured. Though thoroughly out of patience with Severian's experiments, she suggests visiting W'nahja's admirers to see if they can help you in your quest. Speak with adventurers in the Quicksand and merchants at the Ruby Road Exchange to learn of any objects that could suit the guildmaster's needs."
3,"TEXT_CLSALC500_00650_SEQ_03","After speaking with W'nahja's admirers, you learn that the conjurer was fond of a certain wand. Recreate her high-quality budding rosewood wand and affix to it a grade three quicktongue materia, before delivering the weapon to Severian at the Alchemists' Guild."
4,"TEXT_CLSALC500_00650_SEQ_04","With the final component of the process in place, Severian finally succeeds in resurrecting W'nahja. The reunion, however, is short-lived─after dispelling the guildmaster's lingering feelings of guilt, the conjurer fades into the aether. Speak with the guildmaster and learn what he intends to do now."
5,"TEXT_CLSALC500_00650_SEQ_05","Freed at last from his years-long obsession, the master alchemist urges you to join him in his continuing exploration of the limitless realm of alchemy.

57,"TEXT_CLSALC500_00650_WBULEA_000_012","W'nahja and I were once insatiable wanderers, you see. We traveled the world, practicing the arts of conjury. It was in Ul'dah, however, where we found a home. And where W'nahja found Severian."
