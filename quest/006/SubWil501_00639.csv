51,"TEXT_SUBWIL501_00639_FHOBHAS_011","The first of these is carbonized matter, a catalyst required in the melding process. The substance is found throughout nature. If you want to know how to go about gathering it, Kokosamu there can tell you."
52,"TEXT_SUBWIL501_00639_FHOBHAS_012","Next, you need to be aware of materia slots. Arms and armor each have a certain number of these slots, and this determines how many pieces of materia they can host."
53,"TEXT_SUBWIL501_00639_FHOBHAS_013","Arms and armor each have a certain number of these slots, and this determines how many pieces of materia they can host.
