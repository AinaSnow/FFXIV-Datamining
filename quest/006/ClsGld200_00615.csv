51,"TEXT_CLSGLD200_00615_SERENDIPITY_000_4","<sigh> Pardon my outburst. That's not why you're here. Keeping your skills sharp, I trust? You know, it occurs to me that the past two tasks I gave you weren't proper lessons. How about I teach you something new?"
52,"TEXT_CLSGLD200_00615_SERENDIPITY_000_5","What do you know about materia? Wait, don't answer that. Even if you're familiar with it, 'tis my duty as guildmaster to instruct you in its applications to our craft."
53,"TEXT_CLSGLD200_00615_SERENDIPITY_000_7","So let's review the basics: materia are special crystals you can use to enhance the properties of items."
54,"TEXT_CLSGLD200_00615_SERENDIPITY_000_8","Now, attaching these crystals requires an artisan's touch. So for this lesson, I want you to attach materia to an item."
55,"TEXT_CLSGLD200_00615_SERENDIPITY_000_9","Not any item, mind you, but a staghorn staff, which I would have you craft yourself. This particular staff may prove difficult to construct, if only because the requisite horns must be cut from antelopes, which are not native to Thanalan."
56,"TEXT_CLSGLD200_00615_SERENDIPITY_000_10","If you wish to purchase some, you might have some luck searching over at the Sapphire Avenue Exchange. If that doesn't yield what you seek, a trip to Gridania may be in order."
57,"TEXT_CLSGLD200_00615_SERENDIPITY_000_11","There're numerous types of materia out there, but it's entirely up to you what you use. I'm only concerned with your ability to attach it, after all."
58,"TEXT_CLSGLD200_00615_SERENDIPITY_000_12","Oh, and I almost forgot the most important part! If all this talk of materia makes absolutely no sense, you could go to central Thanalan and learn from Master Mutamix himself! Though, to be honest, I didn't understand a word he said..."

64,"TEXT_CLSGLD200_00615_SERENDIPITY_000_18","As for your staff...it's very well made, and the materia is perfectly melded. Nicely done."
65,"TEXT_CLSGLD200_00615_SERENDIPITY_000_19","Perhaps you're wondering who would prefer a staff with a headpiece of bone over one studded with jewels. Well, the thaumaturges favor such equipment."
66,"TEXT_CLSGLD200_00615_SERENDIPITY_000_20","Fangs and horns are the weapons of beasts, used to kill and defend. Few materials are better suited than these for channeling the dark arts, or so I understand."
67,"TEXT_CLSGLD200_00615_SERENDIPITY_000_21","I'm the furthest thing there is from a trained thaumaturge, but even I can sense the arcane magicks residing within this staff."
