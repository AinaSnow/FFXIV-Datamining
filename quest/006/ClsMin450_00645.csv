1,"TEXT_CLSMIN450_00645_SEQ_01","Ever since losing to you in the latest contest, Wide Gulley has been taking on tasks like a man possessed. However, Adalberta suspects that more is driving him than simply the sting of defeat. Concerned for his health, she bids you speak with Wide Gulley in order to learn the truth of the matter."
2,"TEXT_CLSMIN450_00645_SEQ_02","Wide Gulley reveals to you that his father has been tampering with official records in order to enhance his standing in the guild. Deeply ashamed, he has taken on a throng of tasks in the hopes of turning Deep Canyon's lies into truths. Unfortunately, he has bitten off more than he can chew, and begs you to fulfill an order in his stead. Make your way to Camp Bronze Lake in upper La Noscea, and obtain twenty chunks of high-quality electrum ore on your guildmate's behalf."
3,"TEXT_CLSMIN450_00645_SEQ_03","You have delivered the electrum ore to a grateful Wide Gulley, who goes on to compare himself to brass─pretty to behold, but worth little. Will the man ever be able to meet the high expectations he has of himself?

※The next miner quest will be available from Adalberta upon reaching level 50."

49,"TEXT_CLSMIN450_00645_ADALBERTA_000_001","He's recovered from the wounds suffered in Coerthas and resumed his mining for the guild. Wonderful news, to be sure, but one thing yet troubles me."
50,"TEXT_CLSMIN450_00645_ADALBERTA_000_002","You see, Wide Gulley has been taking on far more tasks than a single man should. Some attribute his newfound fervor to the sting of losing that ill-conceived jade contest, but I suspect there's more to the tale."
51,"TEXT_CLSMIN450_00645_ADALBERTA_000_003","I tried to broach the subject with him, but he's as stubborn as an aurochs, insisting it's naught but my imagination.

53,"TEXT_CLSMIN450_00645_WIDEGULLEY_000_010","Hmph, no doubt Adalberta sent you. She's been on me somethin' fierce since I came back. But it doesn't matter why you're here or at whose request. The simple truth is I need your help."
54,"TEXT_CLSMIN450_00645_WIDEGULLEY_000_011","I've got a secret that would be sure to bring great shame on my family, but I need to tell <Emphasis>someone</Emphasis>, and I know that you're an honest sort."
55,"TEXT_CLSMIN450_00645_WIDEGULLEY_000_012","Ledgers at the Concern have been tampered with, and I'm bein' credited for work I didn't do. Wasn't keen on believin' it, but the culprit is...my own father."
56,"TEXT_CLSMIN450_00645_WIDEGULLEY_000_013","I first suspected somethin' was off when I received my last evaluation. I know better'n anyone what I do 'round here, and I knew I wasn't workin' <Emphasis>that</Emphasis> much."
57,"TEXT_CLSMIN450_00645_WIDEGULLEY_000_014","I looked over the Concern's records of its dealin's with the guild, and, sure as day, I found some right damnin' evidence. Heh...didn't know whether to laugh or cry."
58,"TEXT_CLSMIN450_00645_WIDEGULLEY_000_015","I <Emphasis>never</Emphasis> wanted it said that I had a leg up in the guild 'cause I'm the vice foreman's son.

60,"TEXT_CLSMIN450_00645_WIDEGULLEY_000_017","So, like I said, adventurer, I need your help. I'd say I'm swallowin' my pride to ask you this, but I've got no pride left. Whatever happens from here on out, I'm a miner first and foremost, and I just want to do my job."
61,"TEXT_CLSMIN450_00645_WIDEGULLEY_000_018","Right now, the order givin' me the biggest headache is one for twenty chunks of high-purity electrum ore. You can find the stuff south of Camp Bronze Lake, over in upper La Noscea. Please hurry. And...thanks."

66,"TEXT_CLSMIN450_00645_WIDEGULLEY_000_034","Bah, what am I sayin'? That comparison ain't fair to electrum. At least this alloy is <Emphasis>worth</Emphasis> somethin'."
67,"TEXT_CLSMIN450_00645_WIDEGULLEY_000_035","You see, when refined, electrum takes on an opulent whitish hue not seen in other metals. An' there're certain things that can't be made without it, so it's prized by crafters."
68,"TEXT_CLSMIN450_00645_WIDEGULLEY_00036","No... No, if I'm to liken myself to any metal, it'd have to be common brass."
69,"TEXT_CLSMIN450_00645_WIDEGULLEY_000_037","Stuff's pretty enough to look at when polished, but worth little and less."
70,"TEXT_CLSMIN450_00645_WIDEGULLEY_000_038","Gah! I had dreams of bein' special─a one-of-a-kind type of miner everyone respected. But now...now I just..."
