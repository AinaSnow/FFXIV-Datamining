1,"TEXT_CLSWVR400_00652_SEQ_01","Redolent Rose has tasked you with a commission for Kokomo, the object of Wawarukka's affections. Seeing an opportunity, he has also asked you to subtly inquire as to her feelings towards the miner. Speak with Kokomo at the Gold Court to learn more of the commission and of her heart."
2,"TEXT_CLSWVR400_00652_SEQ_02","Kokomo knows full well who Wawarukka is, and appears to harbor no ill will towards him. As for the commission, she has asked you to craft a pair of quality woolen tights. Prepare the item as requested and deliver it to Redolent Rose."
3,"TEXT_CLSWVR400_00652_SEQ_03","During the fitting, Kokomo unintentionally reveals that she has feelings for her secret admirer. Now knowing that Wawarukka's efforts will not be in vain, the guildmaster ponders how he can prevent Wawarukka from botching another attempt to win the young woman's heart.

※The next weaver quest will be available from Redolent Rose upon reaching level 45."

54,"TEXT_CLSWVR400_00652_KOKOMO_012","Ahahaha, what a coincidence! He visited the shop the other day! You should have seen Father's face when he chased him away─thankfully, he didn't recognize him. What ever possessed him to wear such a ridiculous outfit?"
55,"TEXT_CLSWVR400_00652_KOKOMO_013","It's a shame, really. It feels like he hasn't visited in forever! I would have liked to have spoken with him..."
