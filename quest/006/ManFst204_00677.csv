2,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_SEQ_02","You learn that the Lambs of Dalamud believe in the divinity of the lesser moon whose descent ushered in the Seventh Umbral Era. Since Dalamud's apparent destruction─for which they blame the people of Eorzea─it seems they have been seeking a means to avenge their god. Purge the Deepcroft of cultists before they can put their deranged schemes into action.

After a titanic struggle, you succeed in sending this dark being back to the abyss, thus foiling the cultists' plot. Make haste back to Gridania, and report all that has transpired to Miounne."

She attributes this unfortunate trend to the burgeoning demand for adventurers' services, which has allowed unprepared individuals to take on tasks which are beyond them. Confident that you will give her no cause to worry, Miounne informs you that the Adventurers' Guild in Ul'dah is recruiting. Speak with her again if you would know more."

73,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_GODSQUIVERBOW_000_35","Now, having seen their god turn to ash, one would think that the cultists might feel moved to question their faith. On the contrary, it served only to stoke the flames of their fanaticism."
