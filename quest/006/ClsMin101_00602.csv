1,"TEXT_CLSMIN101_00602_SEQ_01","The guild has received an order from Amajina & Sons Mineral Concern for ninety-nine chunks of obsidian. Procure the requisite number in the vicinity of the Hammers in western Thanalan, and deliver them to Adalberta."
2,"TEXT_CLSMIN101_00602_SEQ_02","You learn that the fruits of your labors will be utilized in the crafting of macuahuimeh, a type of wooden sword which predates metalworking. Although obsidian is no longer widely used, there are still some who will pay good coin for it. Adalberta encourages you to be aware of the needs of such customers, as the demand for materials with highly specific applications often outstrips supply.

※The next miner quest will be available from Adalberta upon reaching level 15."
