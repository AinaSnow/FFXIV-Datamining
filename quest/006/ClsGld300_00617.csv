50,"TEXT_CLSGLD300_00617_SERENDIPITY_000_3","A traveling merchant was here not a bell ago to discuss a potential contract with us. In the midst of negotiations, Gigi commented on the man's jewelry, claiming “such tawdry baubles are beneath even a Lominsan whore.” Unsurprisingly, the man became quite upset and stormed off."

80,"TEXT_CLSGLD300_00617_SERENDIPITY_000_35","It's a gift, and it can't be taught, much as I wish it could. No, you've always had it in you. And as you grow more skilled, you'll only become better at expressing it."
81,"TEXT_CLSGLD300_00617_SERENDIPITY_000_36","I'm certain that was part of Roroton's decision. Since we know he'll request your services when he next visits, you'd best work hard until the time comes!"
82,"TEXT_CLSGLD300_00617_ROROTON_000_50","It was a pleasure meeting you. I believe we will have a most profitable relationship in the days to come."
