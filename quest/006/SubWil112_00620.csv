2,"TEXT_SUBWIL112_00620_SEQ_02","Marques has directed you to an empty grave atop the nearby ridge. Bear the embalmed corpse to the gravesite."
3,"TEXT_SUBWIL112_00620_SEQ_03","You have gently placed the embalmed body at the foot of the grave. Perform one final duty for the deceased and provide him a proper burial."

5,"TEXT_SUBWIL112_00620_SEQ_05","Marques admits to knowing little of the commonfolk. He suggests you speak to Sister Ourcen within the church."
6,"TEXT_SUBWIL112_00620_SEQ_06","Sister Ourcen informs you that while the commonfolk confide a great many things in her, she has not heard anything that might help your investigation. Return to Camp Drybone and speak to Isembard once more."
7,"TEXT_SUBWIL112_00620_SEQ_07","Upon your return to Isembard at Camp Drybone, the ever-dashing Thancred appears to greet you. To Isembard's dismay, he suspects that the only person who could take the vigilant commonfolk by surprise is the very Sister Ourcen who takes their confession. Isembard, however, is not so easily convinced."

60,"TEXT_SUBWIL112_00620_OURCEN_000_31","Hm? You seek knowledge of missing Drybone inhabitants? It is true I am closer to the people than any other of the Order. I confide in them, and they in me. When they wish to speak to their keeper, Thal, I am the medium through which they do."

67,"TEXT_SUBWIL112_00620_THANCRED_000_53","I, too, spoke with Ungust─more times than I care to count. There seems to be some truth to this notion of the commonfolk speaking their secrets only to those in service to the gods."
68,"TEXT_SUBWIL112_00620_THANCRED_000_54","Prostration, prayer, penance. Abject deeds done behind closed doors, away from prying eyes. Who better to take the pious unawares than she who takes confession─the good Sister Ourcen herself?"
