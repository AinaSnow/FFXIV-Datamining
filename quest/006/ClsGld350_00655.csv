1,"TEXT_CLSGLD350_00655_SEQ_01","Roroton, the merchant for whom you previously crafted a pair of malachite earrings, has commissioned you to make a fire brand of peerless quality. Craft the item to the best of your ability and present it to Serendipity for inspection."
2,"TEXT_CLSGLD350_00655_SEQ_02","As usual, Gigi assists with the evaluation of your work. However, in an unusual turn of events, your fire brand appears to trigger bizarre pyromaniac tendencies hidden deep within the mammet's soul. Nevertheless, Serendipity assures you that there is no need for concern, and that she will see that Roroton receives his order without incident.

※The next goldsmith quest will be available from Serendipity upon reaching level 40."
