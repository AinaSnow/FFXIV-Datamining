1,"TEXT_CLSMIN350_00643_SEQ_01","Adalberta has asked you to obtain twenty high-quality raw amethysts. Confessing that the gemstones are not her specialty, she bids you speak with Wide Gulley to learn where they might be found."
2,"TEXT_CLSMIN350_00643_SEQ_02","Wide Gulley obliges you with the information, but only because he is certain that you will fail at your task. Being careful to avoid the fearsome creatures in the area, make your way to Hopeseed Pond in the Central Shroud, and obtain twenty high-quality raw amethysts. Once you have the required quantity, present them to Wide Gulley."
3,"TEXT_CLSMIN350_00643_SEQ_03","Wide Gulley cannot hide his surprise that you were able to brave the dangers to procure the amethysts. To your credit, the man has come to see you as a rival, and expresses his intent to redouble his efforts. Keep working at your craft, that you might be prepared when the next contest inevitably comes.

※The next miner quest will be available from Adalberta upon reaching level 40."
