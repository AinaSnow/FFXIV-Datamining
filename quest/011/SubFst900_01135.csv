51,"TEXT_SUBFST900_01135_NEDRICK_000_003","If the thought of delving into the past sets your loins afire, the keep will surely serve to quench it. The entrance is watched by a Wood Wailer named Maxinne. Give her my name, and she will tell you all you need to know."

Some of the cultists have even succeeded in summoning voidsent, and we Wood Wailers welcome capable adventurers who would be willing to keep their numbers in check."
