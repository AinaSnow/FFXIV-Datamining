1,"TEXT_GAIUSE115_01189_SEQ_01","Claiming to have information on an imminent threat to mooglekind and Gridanian alike, Kuplo Kopp has petitioned the Elder Seedseer for an audience. Speak to the silent conjurer to gain admission to the Lotus Stand, where the moogle will explain all."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSE115_01189_SEQ_02","Good King Moggle Mog, the Twelfth of His Name, has returned to Gridania after a five-year absence. Though the precise nature of said quasi-mythical being is debatable, all present agree that the danger he poses is akin to that of a primal. Convinced of the need to act, Kan–E–Senna beseeches you to drive the king out of the Twelveswood, urging you to consult Brother E–Sumi–Yan upon the matter of how his magical defenses might be breached."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSE115_01189_SEQ_03","Brother E–Sumi–Yan takes great comfort in your arrival, observing that the influence of Good King Moggle Mog XII could forever corrupt mooglekind's peaceful nature if nothing is done. Before explaining how you might reach the legendary king, the conjurer bids you see to whatever preparations you feel are necessary for the coming confrontation."

66,"TEXT_GAIUSE115_01189_KUPLOKOPP_000_026","Once upon a time, we moogles served the gods in the heavens. It was quite nice up there─unspeakably beautiful, unimaginably spacious, and with a literally endless supply of wine, kupo!"
67,"TEXT_GAIUSE115_01189_KUPLOKOPP_000_027","In spite of this, or possibly because of the last part, the gods eventually became discontented and started squabbling, which made life jolly difficult for the poor moogles."
68,"TEXT_GAIUSE115_01189_KUPLOKOPP_000_028","So Good King Moggle Mog XII─may his glorious name live forever─decreed that the time had come to leave, kupo! The realm of man would suffice, he said, so all the moogles should live there instead."

This he nobly held while his subjects climbed all the way down to the world below."
