52,"TEXT_CLSFSH011_01107_NNMULIKA_000_021","But unfortuitously, unfortunately, and somewhat ironically, our nefarious netmaster is out fishing at the moment. This moment and every moment, that is."

56,"TEXT_CLSFSH011_01107_SISIPU_000_030","Yes, yes, save your breath. I heard every word between you and N'nmulika, so I know she told you my role here."

59,"TEXT_CLSFSH011_01107_SISIPU_000_033","...You've passed the first test by not laughing at that awful joke. Now you only need the right answer to this question: are you prepared to fish like you've never fished before?"

64,"TEXT_CLSFSH011_01107_SISIPU_000_050","Well! You're smarter than the majority of bottom-dwellers that find their way here. Welcome to the guild!"
65,"TEXT_CLSFSH011_01107_SISIPU_000_051","Now, this wouldn't be much of a guild if we sent you out to sea with only a pole and a prayer, so I suppose I can spare you a few pearls of wisdom."
66,"TEXT_CLSFSH011_01107_SISIPU_000_052","Nevertheless, you're still going to need that pole and prayer, so I can at least provide you with the former. Here you go. One out of two isn't bad. I'll even throw in these lugworms, since you're not like to get far without bait."
67,"TEXT_CLSFSH011_01107_SISIPU_000_053","The rods we bestow upon our new fish are priceless objects, which is to say they don't cost anything. Once you know what you're doing, you'll probably want a proper one."
68,"TEXT_CLSFSH011_01107_SISIPU_000_054","But in the meantime, let's see if you can figure out how to hold your pole. Ready the one I gave you and your lessons can begin."
