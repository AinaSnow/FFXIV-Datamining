※This quest is available for a limited time only."

According to rumor, the mysterious warrior is said to be hunting a monstrosity in the wilds beyond the walls of Ul'dah. Conduct your search near Highbridge in eastern Thanalan, or in the vicinity of Little Ala Mhigo in southern Thanalan.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."

After giving your account of events to an enthralled Dural Tharal, the reporter eagerly suggests opening the strange package. Inside, he discovers an unusual garment that he graciously returns to your possession. If the gossip Dural Tharal describes is any indication, Lightning's appearances seem to have become the favored subject of every rumormonger and tale-teller in Eorzea."
