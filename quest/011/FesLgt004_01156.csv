※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESLGT004_01156_SEQ_01","Kipih Jakkya has learned that Lightning, the lady–knight with whom you have crossed paths several times before, is being pursued by fell demons. The intrepid reporter implores you to journey to Mor Dhona and offer your assistance to the enigmatic warrior. Should you encounter Lightning, Kipih Jakkya would like to hear of your experiences, as well as examine any evidence of her passing you might acquire.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESLGT004_01156_SEQ_02","After fighting alongside Lightning and helping her vanquish her black-hearted pursuers, you once again come into possession of an otherworldly parcel. You return to Gridania and hand the parcel to Kipih Jakkya, at which point Lightning once more appears at your side. The lady–knight speaks of her desire to remain in Eorzea, but your bravery has rekindled her own sense of determination. Drawn away by inexorable forces, Lightning returns to a world besieged by chaos and destruction. In whatever distant land she calls home, you are certain that her struggles continue."
