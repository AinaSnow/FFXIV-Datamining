1,"TEXT_GAIUSE101_01175_SEQ_01","Ever since your famous victory over Gaius van Baelsar, the halls of the Waking Sands have been thronged with petitioners seeking to engage the Scions' services for personal gain. Although Minfilia is loath to entertain their dubious proposals, she wonders if accepting such patronage might ultimately empower the order to do greater good. Before making any decision, she would like to hear the opinions of your fellow Scions. Speak with Thancred, Y'shtola, Yda, Papalymo, and Urianger."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSE101_01175_SEQ_02","As expected, the other Scions are deeply concerned about the ideological implications of accepting conditional support. Perhaps Alphinaud can offer a different perspective on the matter?"
3,"TEXT_GAIUSE101_01175_SEQ_03","Alphinaud seizes the opportunity to make a bold counter-proposal: move the Scions' headquarters to Mor Dhona, beyond the borders of Ul'dah and the other great nations. Though Minfilia makes a show of listening to the young Elezen's reasoning, she is not to be convinced, decrying his idea as reckless beyond words before unceremoniously dismissing him. As you silently watch Alphinaud take his leave, you sense that, beneath their heated words, another conversation was taking place..."
