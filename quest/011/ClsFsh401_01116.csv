2,"TEXT_CLSFSH401_01116_SEQ_02","In an effort to satisfy the needs of wealthy Ul'dahns, the Consortium seeks five raincallers, which are said to possess certain desirable properties. Raincallers can be fished out of Gridania's Jadeite Flood with stem borers, but only when rain falls, hence their name. Procure the fish and deliver them to Sybell."
