The duty officer doubts that it is the selfsame carriage you seek, but you know there are no coincidences in the North Shroud. Another of Fallgourd Float's finest is on the scene, if you wish to inquire further."

Your suspicions are vindicated, but now a difficult rescue-and-recovery mission is indicated. To the logging grounds you must go, to free the captives and recover whatever provisions remain."
