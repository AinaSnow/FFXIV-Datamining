2,"TEXT_GAIUSE112_01186_SEQ_02","Upon returning to the Waking Sands, Alphinaud declares that preparations for the move to Mor Dhona have fallen behind. Demonstrating an almost Slafbornian eagerness to put you to work, he then bids you scour the headquarters for any packages labeled for shipment to Revenant's Toll. It would seem your report will have to wait."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSE112_01186_SEQ_03","A cursory search yields four labeled packages. Though an average <Sheet(Race,PlayerParameter(71),0)/> might feasibly struggle to carry them all, the same cannot be said of you. Bluntly, you have faced greater challenges. Take the packages to Tataru who is waiting outside."
