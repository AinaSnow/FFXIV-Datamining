1,"TEXT_CLSFSH251_01113_SEQ_01","Using the technique the acting guildmaster has termed “fishwheeling” (more widely known as mooching), you are to use a crayfish ball to catch a high-quality striped goby, and then recast the goby in order to catch a shadow catfish. The fish can be found in the waters surrounding Fallgourd Float in the North Shroud."
