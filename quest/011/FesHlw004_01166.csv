As he tells it, he and his monstrous minions cooked up their scheme in hopes for a return to the old days, when All Saints' Wake afforded an opportunity for his kind to frolic and purvey mischief in town. Assuring you that he means no harm, you agree to keep his secret. All told, this has proven to be an eventful All Saints' Wake─though the true identity of the disembodied voice that guided you to the truth remains cloaked in shadows..."
