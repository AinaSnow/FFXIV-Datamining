2,"TEXT_GAIUSD015_01198_SEQ_02","After scrutinizing the uncanny objects of bone, Rowena appears satisfied that they will sell for a handsome sum. Deliver the ritual tools to Laraina, the merchant's acquisitions officer, and formalize the transaction."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSD015_01198_SEQ_03","You deliver the primal trophies to Laraina, and receive three tokens in exchange. With such tokens in your possession, you are now able to make a selection from Rowena's stock of high-quality armaments. Laraina explains that should you wish to obtain more of their weapons, you need only bring her another set of “stomach-churning” ritual foci."

Certain of her clientele are like to salivate at the very thought of possessing such forbidden items─there are few who can lay claim to the ownership of a ritual tool employed in the summoning of a primal."
51,"TEXT_GAIUSD015_01198_URIANGER_100_002","There is no cause for alarum. Any power the objects once held has long since been surrendered to the summoned deities. And lest thou worry on my account, I have gleaned from them what wisdom we required."
