1,"TEXT_CLSWDK502_01997_SEQ_01","Timbermaster Beatin produces a spear shaft found in the North Shroud. Though the head has broken off, he proceeds to identify it as Ishgardian in origin and fawn over its quality. He feels that such a treasure must be returned to its rightful owner, and asks you as a well-traveled adventurer to visit the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly in Ishgard. Make your way there, and find a veteran knight who might be able to tell you to whom the spear once belonged."
2,"TEXT_CLSWDK502_01997_SEQ_02","You speak with a veteran knight, who informs you that the broken spear is most likely that of a long-dead member of the order. He directs you to this man's son, Barthovieu, known to frequent the Brume."
3,"TEXT_CLSWDK502_01997_SEQ_03","Barthovieu, a lowly soldier, accepts the broken lance in amazement. He tells you his father was weak, a knight who left to fight Dravanians, but instead died an honorless death at the claws of mere beastkin. Barthovieu now lives in squalor as a struggling single father. For the sake of his son, he means to earn himself knighthood by hunting dragons. However, he needs a bow to do so, and would ask you to make him one after he can scrape together the necessary funds.

※The next carpenter quest will be available from Barthovieu upon reaching level 53."

52,"TEXT_CLSWDK502_01997_BEATINE_000_004","To a master, however, the love of both carpenter and wielder for this weapon is obvious. The haft has been worn smooth through use, revealing the quilted pattern of the wood."

70,"TEXT_CLSWDK502_01997_BARTHOVIEU_000_036","But I'll not fight with the spear. I've no desire to be mauled to death, like my father. The bow's my weapon now. Or it would be, if I had a proper one to hunt dragons."
