1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ907_01972_SEQ_01","A knight from House Fortemps has received a letter addressed directly to you, and upon opening it you realize it was sent by none other than Kuplo Kopp. Apparently he and the Moghome moogles have been getting along famously, and they have decided to have a get-together of the Twelveswood and Moghome moogles, to deepen the bond between them. He invites─or rather, demands─your presence at the festivities, saying that a moogle by the name of Mogule awaits your arrival at Moghome. Head to Moghome at the Churning Mists and speak to your excited host when you arrive."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ907_01972_SEQ_02","It seems that before the arrival of Kuplo Kopp and the others from the surface, the existence of the Twelveswood moogles was a mystery to most of Moghome. Mogule is quite curious as to why the moogles of the surface and sky are not living together, and decides that it might be best to ask Chieftain Moglin to shed some light on the mystery of their separation."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ907_01972_SEQ_03","Chieftain Moglin, being a busy moogle himself, proposes that the answer to the mystery of the moogles' separation wait until the Twelveswood moogles arrive at Moghome. Mogule, amazed at Moglin's insightful decision, heads off to meet the soon-to-be-arriving moogles, and bids you follow him. Meet with Mogule and wait to greet the undoubtedly tired Twelveswood moogles. "
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ907_01972_SEQ_04","You arrive to find Mogule eagerly awaiting the Twelveswood moogles, but despite it being well past the appointed time, there is not a pom-pom in sight. If the moogles aren't at Moghome, then where could they be...?"
