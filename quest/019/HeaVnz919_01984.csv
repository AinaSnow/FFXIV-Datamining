3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ919_01984_SEQ_03","With the reduced rate of spore output, the life support system is now able to purify the air faster than it is being polluted. The abnormally high corpse flower population seems to have been caused by an airborne growth stimulation medium released from the ecological synthesis research facility."
