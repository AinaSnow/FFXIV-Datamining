Though they attack, you repel them with ease, and ensure they will no more trouble travelers. Return to Woolnix's friend, and give him the news."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ832_01962_SEQ_04","The goblin is much relieved to learn he will no longer fall under attack from the mammets. He says he will finish his junk hunting, and then return to the Cenotaph. Make your way back there, and give your full report to Woolnix."
