1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ827_01957_SEQ_01","Drydox tells you of plans afoot to move the capital of the new goblin republic from Idyllshire to the abandoned buildings of the Answering Quarter. However, the goblin she has sent to survey the site, a novice by the name of Boomshox, has yet to return. She bids you to head into the Dravanian hinterlands and check on Boomshox's safety."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ827_01957_SEQ_02","You find Boomshox alive and well, yet distinctly disgruntled. She is keen to conclude her survey as quickly as possible, but the local wildlife insist on interfering with her work. She asks you to slay five crawlers in the vicinity of the Answering Quarter, so that she might finish her fieldwork in peace."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ827_01957_SEQ_03","You slay the crawlers, making the local area safer for mapmaking goblins. Return to Boomshox to report your success."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ827_01957_SEQ_04","Boomshox is pleased to hear of your victory over the crawlers and pledges to resume her fieldwork with renewed vigor. There is still much and more to be surveyed, but the sooner she completes her work, the sooner she can return home to Idyllshire."
