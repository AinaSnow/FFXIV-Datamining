1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ824_01954_SEQ_01","Notched Bone is finally back on his feet after eating the inedible crawler flesh. While incapacitated, he saw a goblin he thought looked extremely suspicious. Since he has not yet fully recovered, he has requested your help in following this goblin. He asks you to meet him and Dedean outside of Idyllshire, in the Answering Quarter. Accompany them on their investigation and make sure they don't cause any problems."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ824_01954_SEQ_02","You find Notched Bone and Dedean just outside the city, in the Answering Quarter. They've lost sight of the goblin, but intend to continue southward in the hopes of catching him in some evil act."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ824_01954_SEQ_03","In the Answering Quarter, you happen upon a man in no small amount of pain. Notched Bone is sure that the goblins are responsible, but the man insists he was not attacked by them. Notched Bone abandons the man, running back to Idyllshire to plan his next move. Fortunately, the man does not seem to be worried about his own condition, instead expressing concern at Notched Bone's apparent misunderstanding of the situation. Return to Idyllshire and find out what Notched Bone is intending to do next."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ824_01954_SEQ_04","Notched Bone has spoken with Dedean and the two both agree that they must abandon their plan of founding a new settlement. They cannot bring themselves to abandon the citizens of Idyllshire, who they see as being under the malevolent influence of the goblins."

I'm sure he was up to no good. 'Course, I couldn't move, so I couldn't follow him and find out what he was up to."
