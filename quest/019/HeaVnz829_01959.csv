1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ829_01959_SEQ_01","Boomshox has nearly finished the fieldwork assigned to her by Drydox, but the last item on the list eludes her─she has been instructed to pluck three feathers from the Orn kites that live in the hills behind Saint Mocianne's Arboretum. However, the birds are less keen to part with their feathers than the goblin first imagined. Boomshox begs you to dispatch three of the creatures and pluck their feathers, so that she might finally return to the comfort and safety of Idyllshire."

3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ829_01959_SEQ_03","You deliver the Orn kite feathers to Boomshox, completing her allocation of fieldwork. While she puts her results in order, she asks that you return to Idyllshire ahead of her and inform Drydox of her success."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ829_01959_SEQ_04","You report to Drydox, who is amazed that a novice like Boomshox has completed what she believed to be an impossible task. As Boomshox has proven herself to be eminently suited to surveyance, Drydox resolves to entrust all such fieldwork to the novice in future. Just how Boomshox will react to this vote of confidence remains to be seen..."
