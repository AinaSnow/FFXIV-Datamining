1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ635_01903_SEQ_01","Fabrellet recently discovered several gastornis nests east of the Rosehouse, and was struck with an incredible idea. All he requires to set his plan into motion is a single egg. Make your way east of the Rosehouse, and retrieve an egg from one of the gastornis nests."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ635_01903_SEQ_02","You have obtained a gastornis egg. Return to Camp Cloudtop and deliver it to Fabrellet."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ635_01903_SEQ_03","You deliver a still-warm egg to Fabrellet who is now giddy with excitement. It seemed as though he intended to make the egg his next meal, but in truth, his plan is to raise a bird of his own for an ever-ready supply of eggs."
