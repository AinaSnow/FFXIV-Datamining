1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ632_01900_SEQ_01","Camp Cloudtop's food reserves are running low, and Fabrellet needs your help to keep his men from going hungry. To accomplish this, he plans on using meat from wisents grazing north of the camp until a new shipment of provisions arrives. Slay the wisents north of Camp Cloudtop and obtain four slabs of their meat."

3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ632_01900_SEQ_03","You deliver the meat to Fabrellet, who thanks you for your swift work. He is grateful the wisents are present for just such an occasion. As it turns out, they are not indigenous to the islands, but were brought to serve as livestock. He goes on to say they plan to raise sheep as well, but for now they will settle for the less-than-savory meat of wisents. "
