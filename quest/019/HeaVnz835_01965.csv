She tells you that it is not unusual to see bandits in the hinterlands─after all, the Sharlayan ruins make perfect hideouts for outlaws on the run from the city–states of Eorzea. However, this is the first time their criminal avarice has posed an existential threat to Idyllshire itself. Midnight Dew thanks you for your assistance in capturing the criminals─now that her stock is returned, trade with the goblins can continue and the survival of Idyllshire is secured."
