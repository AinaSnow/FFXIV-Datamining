1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ816_01946_SEQ_01","Holepix has learned that the Illuminati have made new machines of war, great mechanical men that he fears can bring Idyllshire to heel. To prevent this terrible eventuality, he asks that you launch a preemptive strike by destroying three findertype magitek vangobs G-III near the Arkhitekton in the Dravanian hinterlands."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ816_01946_SEQ_02","You find and destroy three findertype magitek vangobs G-III, one after the other. Now that the last of these whirring horrors has fallen, return to Holepix in Idyllshire and give him the good tidings."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ816_01946_SEQ_03","Holepix thanks you for your service to Idyllshire, and tells you how the vangobs came to be. The Illuminati laid hands on old Garlean magitek weapons, disassembled and rebuilt them into something even stronger. Though Holepix is impressed by the ingenuity involved, he also knows they will not hesitate to enslave their fellow goblins, and hopes your efforts will forestall the Illuminati."
