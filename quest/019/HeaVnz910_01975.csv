1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ910_01975_SEQ_01","Kupli Kuki and the other moogle have resolved to go find their friend, who ran off somewhere to the eastern part of the Sea of Clouds. Meet with Kupli Kuki at Ok' Vundu Vana to join in on this terribly long game of hide-and-seek."

On the ground is a kupo nut, one of the several that the moogles brought to share at their meeting in Moghome. You see the rest of the kupo nuts scattered around the area, and Kupli Kuki asks you to collect them in his stead so that he doesn't fall victim to any of the many hungry monsters stalking the area."
