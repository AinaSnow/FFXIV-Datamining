1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ818_01948_SEQ_01","Dripwix has been hard at work formulating new rules and regulations to govern the people of Idyllshire. The first such rule is that meticulous records be kept of all tool rentals. He has prepared a large and comprehensive ledger for recording countless details of each and every tool rental.  While Dripwix concocts yet more rules, take the ledger to Drydox to use for all future tool rentals."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ818_01948_SEQ_02","Drydox is less than pleased by these latest bureaucratic developments. She seems to view these complex new rules as a nightmarish, confusing inconvenience. Return to Dripwix and see what new rules the enterprising goblin has come up with."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ818_01948_SEQ_03","To address the organizational problems being experienced by the Idyllshire patrol force, Dripwix has drafted an amended map of the area, including formalized boundaries and borders for the area claimed by the goblins. Take this map to Tapklix, such that his troops may know where to patrol and how close the Illuminati may stray before a counteroffensive should be launched."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ818_01948_SEQ_04","Tapklix is greatly concerned by the map you deliver to him. He finds its intricacies bafflingly complex and has severe doubts that the goblins he commands will be able to memorize the details of it. Leave him to his worries and let Dripwix know that you have delivered the map as requested."
5,"TEXT_HEAVNZ818_01948_SEQ_05","Dripwix seems satisfied for now that his new rules will address at least some of the more obvious problems that Idyllshire has been experiencing. He expresses his intent to continue looking for problems at the settlement and drafting rules to address them."
