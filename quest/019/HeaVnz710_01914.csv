1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ710_01914_SEQ_01","Gunu Vanu has hatched a plan to make an offering that would surpass even his own mother's. He will present the elder shaman with Ok' Zundu's freshest, juiciest vegetables, but first he needs you to dance for the elder shaman for as-of-yet unknown reasons. Go to Aanu Vanu and show him your finest /dance."

He begins to regale you with a story of his youth before he points out that Gunu Vanu is nowhere to be seen. Most likely he is waiting somewhere with the fruits of his plan. Find him and see what he was plotting."

5,"TEXT_HEAVNZ710_01914_SEQ_05","The wise and respected Aanu Vanu is able to see through Gunu Vanu's deception and rejects his offering. However, he agrees to let Gunu Vanu try again on one condition: that none tell Aanu Vanu's wife about the secret supply of vegetables. As the saying in Ok' Zundu goes, “One talon washes the other.”"
