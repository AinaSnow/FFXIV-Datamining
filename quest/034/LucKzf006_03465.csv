49,"TEXT_LUCKZF006_03465_NYMET_000_001","Several days ago we sighted a young girl wandering the wood. We loosed warning arrows, and she fled back whence she came. However, she dropped these earrings in her haste."
50,"TEXT_LUCKZF006_03465_NYMET_000_002","I bear no ill will toward her, so I would like to return them, but I cannot leave. If it is not too much trouble, could you bring them to their owner?"
51,"TEXT_LUCKZF006_03465_NYMET_000_003","As a sign of apology, I would like to affix a Ronkan lilybell to the earrings. They can be found growing in the woods of Yx'Maja. When you are done, please make your way to Slitherbough and find her. I believe she wore her hair in pigtails."
52,"TEXT_LUCKZF006_03465_NYMET_000_004","I apologize for requesting such a menial task from you, but as you know I have little recourse. I simply wish to put her heart at ease."

55,"TEXT_LUCKZF006_03465_SLITHERBOUGHGIRLB03465_000_021","Earrings? Mine have been firmly attached to my ears as far as I know. A friend of mine was lamenting over something she had lost, however..."

63,"TEXT_LUCKZF006_03465_NYMET_000_041","I see. She is kind as well as wise. I shall hang this ring from my neck as a keepsake, to remind me of her. You have my gratitude for everything you have done."
