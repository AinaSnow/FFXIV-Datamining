Nielden would go to the side of someone who needs him."
1,"TEXT_LUCKZE102_03457_SEQ_01","Nielden shares with you some more background about his fallen friend Colphas, and how he raised his daughter Callea all by himself. The Galdjent guard also confesses a lack of confidence that he will be able to offer the girl everything she needs, and asks if you would be willing to go with him and lend a helping hand. Moved by his generosity and sympathy for the orphaned girl's plight, he resolves to make the trip back to Fort Jobb.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_LUCKZE102_03457_SEQ_02","Back at Fort Jobb, Callea profusely expresses her gratitude to you and Nielden, though it is clear that the girl is still struggling to come to terms with her father's sudden passing. Feeling that she is woefully unprepared to follow on in her father's footsteps, she has a mind to close down the infirmary and begin a new life in the Crystarium. At Nielden's asking, you set off for the city to arrange temporary lodgings for Callea with Sylgham at the Catenaries."
3,"TEXT_LUCKZE102_03457_SEQ_03","At the Catenaries, the clerk Sylgham sympathizes with Callea's plight. Despite the recent trying circumstances, he is pleased to be able to inform you a room has just opened up, and offers to reserve it immediately for your orphaned acquaintance. Brave the road back to Fort Jobb and share the good news with your friends."
4,"TEXT_LUCKZE102_03457_SEQ_04","You return to Fort Jobb to a disconcerting scene. Though Nielden and Callea are pleased to hear the news, they seem preoccupied with something that has happened in your absence. Allow Callea a moment to compose herself, and then inquire as to what the matter is."

49,"TEXT_LUCKZE102_03457_NIELDEN_000_001","Colphas lost both his dear wife and parents not long after the girl was born. Raised Callea all by himself, he did. They weren't rich by any means, but still he saw that she wanted for nothing."
50,"TEXT_LUCKZE102_03457_NIELDEN_000_002","I can't even imagine what the poor girl's goin' through, all alone in this dangerous world. As Colphas's close friend, it's my duty to be there for her an' see to whatever she needs."
51,"TEXT_LUCKZE102_03457_NIELDEN_000_003","Come to think of it, don't suppose ye'd be interested in comin' along? I'm just one man, and lookin' after Callea isn't likely to be an easy task."

56,"TEXT_LUCKZE102_03457_NIELDEN_000_013","Think nothin' of it, girl! Poor thing...ye've been through more than any child should have to suffer.

58,"TEXT_LUCKZE102_03457_NIELDEN_000_015","Reckon yer old man is to thank for that. The people loved him, Callea, and they know that his daughter and assistant is cut from the same cloth. Ye've got nothin' to feel guilty about."

60,"TEXT_LUCKZE102_03457_NIELDEN_000_017","Don't even think of blamin' yerself for that, Callea. Yer father went there because he felt it was his duty. A hundred men couldn't have stopped that stubborn bastard once he made up his mind."
61,"TEXT_LUCKZE102_03457_CALLEA_000_018","Yes, this is what everyone tells me. That Father was a talented physician, and a great man. That he is a hero who did not shy in the face of danger, and sacrificed himself in the name of our cause. This I know, and yet...and yet..."

67,"TEXT_LUCKZE102_03457_CALLEA_000_023","The sick and wounded still show up at these doors. My heart aches for them, yet I am but a physician's assistant. I simply cannot offer them the treatment that Father once did."
68,"TEXT_LUCKZE102_03457_CALLEA_000_024","And so I think I will head for the Crystarium. I will shutter the doors of the infirmary, sell the furniture and equipment for what little they are worth, and use the coin to fund my trip."
69,"TEXT_LUCKZE102_03457_NIELDEN_000_025","Aye...perhaps that would be for the best. It'd be safe there, at least, an' as good a place as any to start a new life."

75,"TEXT_LUCKZE102_03457_SYLGHAM_000_041","Your timing is most fortunate. Ever since the raid on Holminster Switch, refugees have been pouring in day after day, and our rooms can only hold so many."
