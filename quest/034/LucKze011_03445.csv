50,"TEXT_LUCKZE011_03445_KARNES_000_002","He was on guard duty that day when the sin eaters attacked. He fought so hard to keep us safe... But I wish he would've thought to save himself."

55,"TEXT_LUCKZE011_03445_VARTHON_000_007","Keep your voice down, before something hears you."
56,"TEXT_LUCKZE011_03445_VARTHON_000_008","I feel horrible for asking after I dragged you out here to find him, but I'd appreciate it if you could help a while longer."
57,"TEXT_LUCKZE011_03445_VARTHON_000_009","I can't stand to see him like this. Knowing him, the only thing that will get him out of this sour mood is finding his father's sword."
58,"TEXT_LUCKZE011_03445_VARTHON_000_010","Would you come with me to look for it? It should be somewhere near where his house used to be."

62,"TEXT_LUCKZE011_03445_SYSTEM03445_100_021","Escort Varthon through the ruins of Fort Gohn. Should you fail to defend him, or move too far away, he will return to the outskirts of Fort Gohn, where you may rendezvous with him before trying again."

73,"TEXT_LUCKZE011_03445_KARNES_000_041","By the blessed Dark, you found it! Holding this sword, it feels like he's right here beside me."
74,"TEXT_LUCKZE011_03445_VARTHON_000_042","I remember that day, when the sin eaters came. His father was one of the bravest men I've ever met."
