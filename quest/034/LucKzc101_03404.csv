Ul Thon has a dream."
1,"TEXT_LUCKZC101_03404_SEQ_01","Rumors are rife that an interesting mortal has come to Il Mheg, and Ul Thon believes that the individual in question is you. Not given to small talk, they then reveal to you their dream: to become the most popular faerie of all. For the first step, they aim to become the darling of Lydha Lran, and to that end they ask your expert opinion on how to best go about it. Upon deciding that they will seek to impress the other pixies with knowledge, Ul Thon sets off for the Bookman's Shelves, and bids you come along to choose and read tomes to them.
