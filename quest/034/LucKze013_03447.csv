49,"TEXT_LUCKZE013_03447_ALSA_000_002","I was preparing to take a walk and tend to the candles about Slitherbough, and I would ask you assist me. I can think of no finer opportunity to learn more of our people."
50,"TEXT_LUCKZE013_03447_ALSA_000_003","Take these three candles, and replace any that appear to be nearly spent. A simple task, I know, but I believe it will prove most illuminating."
51,"TEXT_LUCKZE013_03447_ALSA_000_004","You need only place the three candles I gave you. I will take care of the rest."
52,"TEXT_LUCKZE013_03447_PRAYINGMAN03447_000_010","A fresh candle. How thoughtful of you."
53,"TEXT_LUCKZE013_03447_PRAYINGMAN03447_000_011","Whenever I'm feeling stressed, watching the flames helps settle my nerves. Something about the way they flicker and dance is so soothing to me. Perhaps you should give it a try sometime."
54,"TEXT_LUCKZE013_03447_PRAYINGMAN03447_000_012","Pay me no mind. I'll be returning to work soon enough."
55,"TEXT_LUCKZE013_03447_HELPFULGIRL03447_000_020","Thanks, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>miss<Else/>mister</If>. You're real good at placing candles."
56,"TEXT_LUCKZE013_03447_HELPFULGIRL03447_000_021","Mama says the night sky has candles. Lots and lots of candles. So many you can't count them all. I bet I could, though!"
57,"TEXT_LUCKZE013_03447_HELPFULGIRL03447_000_022","Have you seen the candles outside, in the sky? There's so many! Mama said there's too many to count, but I bet I could if I wanted."
58,"TEXT_LUCKZE013_03447_HELPFULGIRL03447_000_023","They're really pretty, but I think I like the candles in here more."
59,"TEXT_LUCKZE013_03447_HELPFULGIRL03447_000_024","Hey <If(PlayerParameter(4))>miss<Else/>mister</If>, why do you dress so funny? Is it for your work? Mama makes medicine and Papa is a guard. He's always busy outside, so I try to help lots and lots inside. "
60,"TEXT_LUCKZE013_03447_CANDLEWOMAN03447_000_030","Beautiful, aren't they? Like the souls of the departed, burning bright in the sunless sea above."
61,"TEXT_LUCKZE013_03447_CANDLEWOMAN03447_000_031","I often come here to pay respects to our forebears, reflecting on the sacrifices that allowed us to live as we do now."

63,"TEXT_LUCKZE013_03447_ALSA_000_040","You are returned, and enlightened by the experience, I trust. We are a quiet people, but conversation comes easy in the presence of the candles."
64,"TEXT_LUCKZE013_03447_ALSA_000_041","Before the Flood, our worship would no doubt have been seen as profane. Sacrilege..."
65,"TEXT_LUCKZE013_03447_ALSA_000_042","But it is the expression of our faith that defines us, not the object of our worship."
