Sandman would ask a favor of you, assuming he can stay awake long enough."
1,"TEXT_LUCKZD101_03427_SEQ_01","Drawn by enchanted crystals that call to those amaro that have awakened to their kind's long-lost abilities, a young beast has come to Il Mheg. However, he was not prepared for the existence of others like him, and no sooner was he welcomed by Sandman than he bolted and ran. Having been among men until recently, Sandman believes that the startled creature will trust you, and thus are you tasked with finding and bringing him back to Wolekdorf.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_LUCKZD101_03427_SEQ_02","West of Wolekdorf, you come upon the tracks of an amaro who appears to have been in some haste. The trail continues to the southwest, and you follow it."
3,"TEXT_LUCKZD101_03427_SEQ_03","Next, you come upon foliage that has been partially consumed by a large beast. You continue on to the west along the trail of consumption."
4,"TEXT_LUCKZD101_03427_SEQ_04","After a while, you find the remains of a fruit but recently eaten. The young amaro should be somewhere near."
5,"TEXT_LUCKZD101_03427_SEQ_05","At length you succeed in tracking down the young amaro, who introduces himself as Tonatiuh. You inform him of the nature of Wolekdorf and ask him to return with you, but he flatly refuses. It appears his time alone has rendered him uncomfortable with the prospect of being part of a community."

49,"TEXT_LUCKZD101_03427_SANDMAN_000_001","Sandman is my name, and I had...something for you. What was it again? Ah, yes─a request. I would have you seek out a young amaro who has newly arrived in Il Mheg."
50,"TEXT_LUCKZD101_03427_SANDMAN_000_002","But ere I go into the details, tell me: know you the nature of our community, Wolekdorf? It is a place where those of us who have attained intelligence come to live out our days."
51,"TEXT_LUCKZD101_03427_SANDMAN_000_003","We amaro are born mindless beasts, you see, but if we abide among men for a century or so, we may awaken to abilities long lost in our kind, speech not least of all."
52,"TEXT_LUCKZD101_03427_SANDMAN_000_004","That those who have awakened might know of Wolekdorf, we asked our Nu Mou friends to place enchantments on the crystals found throughout Il Mheg. These crystals call out to our brethren across Norvrandt, drawing them hither."
