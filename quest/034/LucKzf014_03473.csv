50,"TEXT_LUCKZF014_03473_FANOW03473_000_002","The beast's master is likely on her way, though I suspect she may need assistance."

61,"TEXT_LUCKZF014_03473_TRAINERVIIS03473_000_022","A barrage of arrows struck it down. At first it made no sense to me─my people would never do such a thing."
62,"TEXT_LUCKZF014_03473_TRAINERVIIS03473_000_023","But on closer inspection, I noticed the arrowheads were made of gold. Only the Children of the Everlasting Dark would use such garish arms. They have grown bold since the Eulmorans attacked. Perhaps too bold..."
63,"TEXT_LUCKZF014_03473_TRAINERVIIS03473_000_024","All the more reason we must remain vigilant. Thank you for your help. Please inform the others the jaculus is safe. I would stay here a while longer."

66,"TEXT_LUCKZF014_03473_FANOW03473_000_030","So the Children were behind this? Long have they coveted the bounty of Yx'Maja."
67,"TEXT_LUCKZF014_03473_FANOW03473_000_031","Their desperation has made them bold, and the presence of Eulmoran soldiers has served only to encourage them. But so long as we yet breathe, these woods will remain beyond their reach."
