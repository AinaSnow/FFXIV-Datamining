50,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_000_002","Perhaps you are a traveler as well? All who embark upon that path have a singular way about them. You must know much of the world outside the wood. Please, could you humor me with a story or two?"
51,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_100_002","Haha, a wise choice. You knew I would not stop at asking for two. Well, if ever you find yourself idle and eager to entertain, I shall be here."
52,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_110_002","You agree!? Oh, many thanks to you. I am so starved for amusement these days."
53,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_000_003","I heard tell that Lakeland had been abandoned. I once heard the name of the elves' new home in passing, but for the life of me I cannot recall it."

57,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_000_004","Yes, yes, the Crystarium. They say that the Crystal Exarch conjured the spire in an instant. Oh, to wield such power..."
58,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_000_005","Eulmore? Are you certain? No...the name had a different ring to it. It was almost...vibrant."

74,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_000_014","Since you have been so kind, I would tell you a story of my own in return. However, it would not do if I were to be overheard. There is a place where we may speak in private, to the west. It will not take long."
75,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_000_019","Thank you for coming. You may wonder why I brought you here. "
76,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_000_020","You see, long ago in these very woods, I was wounded, and nursed back to health by travelers much like yourself. They were hunting a very specific prey, and in exchange for my help they shared stories of the outside world."
77,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_000_021","I remember very fondly that night, huddled by the fire, regaled by their wondrous tales. Although our time together was short, I know for certain there was naught but good in their hearts."
78,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_000_022","When I heard that those selfsame travelers brought about the Flood, I refused to believe it."
79,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_000_023","However, even if it is true, even if they caused this world's ruin... I cannot blame them. If they did somehow have a hand in it...it was not a willing one."
80,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_000_024","You know as well as I, but we Viis can live well over two centuries. I myself have seen my hundredth nameday come and go."

82,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_000_026","Even so, too many of us have met premature ends at the hands of the sin eaters. There are not many left who remember the time before the Flood. "
83,"TEXT_LUCKZF007_03466_FRIENDLYVIIS03466_000_027","That is why I was compelled to tell you of those travelers, so you might leave here with full knowledge of their character. Thank you for lending an ear to my story."
