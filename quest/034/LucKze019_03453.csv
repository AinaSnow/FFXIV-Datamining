48,"TEXT_LUCKZE019_03453_HUNTER03453_000_000","I realize this is sudden, but would you lend me your ear for a moment? I would rather keep this secret from the others if possible. "
49,"TEXT_LUCKZE019_03453_HUNTER03453_000_001","I mean to propose to my beloved, and everything needs to be perfect, right down to where I spring the question."
50,"TEXT_LUCKZE019_03453_HUNTER03453_100_001","Being what I presume to be a worldly traveler, I thought perhaps you could give me your opinion on the view from a few places I had in mind."
51,"TEXT_LUCKZE019_03453_HUNTER03453_000_002","Good, good. My first choice was a quaint little place to the north. Follow me."
52,"TEXT_LUCKZE019_03453_HUNTER03453_000_010","What do you think? I thought the view of Yx'Maja might set the mood."
53,"TEXT_LUCKZE019_03453_HUNTER03453_000_011","A pity we can only view it from afar. I've heard the flowers there are quite beautiful, but the woods there are fiercely guarded."
54,"TEXT_LUCKZE019_03453_HUNTER03453_000_012","Aha, that's it! “My dear, sweet beloved. Let me be the guardian to your ruins of Ronka, now and forevermore.”
Do you think she would accept such a proposal?"
55,"TEXT_LUCKZE019_03453_HUNTER03453_000_013","No...? Well, I will give it some thought. Come, let me show you another spot near Lake Tusi Mek'ta."
56,"TEXT_LUCKZE019_03453_HUNTER03453_000_020","Is the view of the lake not breathtaking?"
57,"TEXT_LUCKZE019_03453_HUNTER03453_000_021","At its bottom rests the Covered Halls of Dwatl, one of several ruins of the Ronkan Empire. "
58,"TEXT_LUCKZE019_03453_HUNTER03453_000_022","Ah! I have it now! “The ruin that is your love has sunk to the bottom of my heart. And there it shall remain for all time.”
The perfect proposal, don't you think?"
59,"TEXT_LUCKZE019_03453_HUNTER03453_000_023","No, you're right. The wording could use a little work. Perhaps my third choice of location will prove inspirational."
60,"TEXT_LUCKZE019_03453_HUNTER03453_000_030","This is perhaps my favorite of the three. Simple, quiet, and peaceful."
61,"TEXT_LUCKZE019_03453_HUNTER03453_000_031","Hmmm... Perhaps that is all I need to propose─a simple expression of my love."
62,"TEXT_LUCKZE019_03453_HUNTER03453_000_032","I realize there is much to consider, so you needn't give me your opinion now. Let us give it due thought while we return to Slitherbough."
63,"TEXT_LUCKZE019_03453_HUNTER03453_000_040","Thank goodness you're here. The more I think on it, the more uncertain I become. Tell me, which place do you think would help me win her heart?"
64,"TEXT_LUCKZE019_03453_Q1_000_000","What will you say?"
65,"TEXT_LUCKZE019_03453_A1_000_001","I think the view of Yx'Maja would be best."
66,"TEXT_LUCKZE019_03453_A1_000_002","The view from the edge of the lake was quite lovely."
67,"TEXT_LUCKZE019_03453_A1_000_003","The calm and quiet at the lake's center would be perfect."
68,"TEXT_LUCKZE019_03453_HUNTER03453_000_050","I suppose there is a certain charm to that place. All right, that is where I'll propose."
69,"TEXT_LUCKZE019_03453_HUNTER03453_000_060","It was, wasn't it? And there'd be no risk of falling in if we remain at its edge. All right, that is where I'll propose."
70,"TEXT_LUCKZE019_03453_HUNTER03453_000_070","The center of the lake, eh? There would be nothing to distract me from telling her how I truly feel. All right, that is where I'll propose."
71,"TEXT_LUCKZE019_03453_HUNTER03453_000_080","I was right to call upon you. What better place than that to offer her my true name."
72,"TEXT_LUCKZE019_03453_HUNTER03453_000_081","...Are you not familiar with the custom? Only immediate family should know one's true name. It's the only way to protect our hearts from the Light."
73,"TEXT_LUCKZE019_03453_HUNTER03453_000_082","Which is why revealing one's name to another is of such great significance. Though I suspect my choice of words in proposing may yet sour the moment."
74,"TEXT_LUCKZE019_03453_HUNTER03453_000_083","But don't you worry. When the time is right, I'm certain the words will flow freely."
