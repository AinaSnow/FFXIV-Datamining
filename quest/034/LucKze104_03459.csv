Callea would use the venom you procured to prepare an antidote."
1,"TEXT_LUCKZE104_03459_SEQ_01","As you keep watch, Callea swiftly mixes the antidote that will cure the unfortunate soldier of the poison that wracks his body. Desperate to get back to her patient's side, she dashes off through the forest alone, potentially putting herself in peril. Follow the girl before any harm comes her way.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_LUCKZE104_03459_SEQ_02","Dashing through the dark wood, you come upon a particularly nasty beast eyeing Callea menacingly. You stride forward, ready to dispose of the foul creature before it feasts on the poor girl."
3,"TEXT_LUCKZE104_03459_SEQ_03","You make short work of your foe, rescuing Callea from an untimely demise. Return with the aspiring physician to Fort Jobb, where she would administer the antidote to her ailing patient."
4,"TEXT_LUCKZE104_03459_SEQ_04","No sooner have you returned to Fort Jobb and reunited with Nielden than does Callea emerge triumphantly from her chamber to inform you that the antidote was remarkably effective─the young soldier will live. What's more, the experience has instilled the girl with a newfound confidence. She explains that, while she appreciates your efforts, she has decided against relocating to the Crystarium in favor of staying behind to take over the infirmary. Grinning from ear to ear, Nielden observes just how much Callea has come to resemble her father, and offers her his continued support as she begins her new career. Exchanging a fond farewell with your friends, you prepare to take to the road once more."
