55,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_ULTHON_000_010","B-But I can't fight or anything. What good am I to you? And yet...a pixie who protects their fellows is a popular pixie!"
56,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_ULTHON_000_015","You'd forsake us in our time of need!? Oh, forget you, then! I'll go and rescue Hagan Nee alone!"
57,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_ULTHON_000_016","...Ahhh! I see what you're doing, you sly mortal! You want to tell me that a pixie who protects their fellows is a popular pixie, isn't that right?"
58,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_PIXIEC03406_000_017","(-Panicked Pixie-)Be that as it may, it's too dangerous by yourself! The two of you should go together!"

69,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_HAGANNEE_000_063","I went to pick a flower, but it turned out to be that fiend's head. If it weren't for you, I would be a dead pixie."
70,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_ULTHON_000_064","I merely tended your wounds. It was this mortal here who saved you from the beast."

72,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_ULTHON_000_066","Heh, it's a fine feeling to be thanked... Come, we should head back to Lydha Lran as well."
73,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_ULTHON_000_070","As much as I want to become popular, I never could've braved such dangers alone. Thank you for giving me the courage."
74,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_ULTHON_000_071","Of course, the most important thing is Hagan Nee is safe. And now we can return to the business of making me popular..."

77,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_HAGANNEE_000_074","(-Hagan Nee-)Some are hurt and need healing. Others need a hand harvesting plants in dangerous places. And what's this we hear about you gifting flowers to everyone?"
78,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_ULTHON_000_075","Oh! Of...of course! I'll take care of everyone in turn. The healing, the harvesting, the gifts─everything!"
79,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_HAGANNEE_000_076","(-Hagan Nee-)Great! We'll leave you to it, then!"
80,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_ULTHON_000_077","To have everyone depend on you... This is what it means to be popular. Ahhh, the feeling is even more wonderful than I imagined!"
81,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_ULTHON_000_078","But ugh... In my glee, I didn't stop to consider how much work it will be. Looks like I'll be busy for a while..."
82,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_ULTHON_000_079","You're popular too, yes? Lots of people depend on you?"
83,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_ULTHON_000_080","Tell me, what is it like? Is it tough to have everyone needing something from you?"
84,"TEXT_LUCKZC104_03407_ULTHON_000_081","Gah, I should've known it's not all milk and honey... But this is what I've dreamed of, and I promise to do my best to live up to it!"
