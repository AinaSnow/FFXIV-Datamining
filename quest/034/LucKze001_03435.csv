49,"TEXT_LUCKZE001_03435_SCHOLAR03435_000_001","Oh, hello there. Forgive me if I seem a bit flustered. I am a scholar specializing in historical architecture, and I've a mind to pay visit to Laxan Loft, that I might assess the full extent of the damage it sustained in the recent stand against the Eulmoran forces."
50,"TEXT_LUCKZE001_03435_SCHOLAR03435_000_002","I had <Emphasis>assumed</Emphasis> that the Crystarium guard would be escorting me there to ensure my safety, but they insist they cannot spare a single man for the task. Why, it is almost as if they believe my research to be of less than the utmost importance!"
51,"TEXT_LUCKZE001_03435_SCHOLAR03435_000_003","What's this? Not only have you set foot inside the castle, you fought in the battle itself! Truly, fortune smiles upon me today! Would you be so kind as to accompany me on my expedition? You would, of course, be handsomely compensated for your services."
52,"TEXT_LUCKZE001_03435_SCHOLAR03435_000_004","Splendid! Then let us be off. My research has waited far too long already!"
53,"TEXT_LUCKZE001_03435_SCHOLAR03435_000_010","There you are. I feared for a moment that you meant to leave me stranded here. Anyhow, as you can see, this place has seen better days. Truly a shame, is it not? I weep for all the historical treasures our realm has lost, and continues to lose..."
54,"TEXT_LUCKZE001_03435_SCHOLAR03435_000_011","In any event, let us have a walk about the premises and take a closer look. I mean to examine the courtyard. Why don't you circle the perimeter and take stock of what you see?"

64,"TEXT_LUCKZE001_03435_SCHOLAR03435_000_033","A harsh judgment, but I cannot disagree. Why, the sight of that once-proud garden now overrun by weeds nigh brought a tear to my eye. The eastern bridge, too, has been all but lost. Truly a pity, indeed..."
65,"TEXT_LUCKZE001_03435_SCHOLAR03435_000_034","It is written in the histories that in the days of old, the elves held sway over all of Norvrandt. Yet they had no interest in establishing a nation, as it were, and thus were gradually driven from their homes by the other races."
66,"TEXT_LUCKZE001_03435_SCHOLAR03435_000_035","Realizing that they had to fight with their lives to defend their claim to the Source─their ancestral holy ground─with their lives, the once-scattered clans banded together, uniting under a single king."

68,"TEXT_LUCKZE001_03435_SCHOLAR03435_000_037","Events took a turn, however, some one hundred years ago. Elven dissidents from the old guard who sought to restore their race to its former glory banded together under the auspices of a figure known only as the Shadowkeeper, and a bloody revolution began..."
69,"TEXT_LUCKZE001_03435_SCHOLAR03435_000_038","Laxan Loft, so proud and glorious, was bathed in fire and stained with blood, the beginning of the devastation that would continue with the Flood and beyond. But going back to the revolution, I came across a most fascinating theory. You see, one school of scholars posits that─"

Take pride in knowing that you have made a great contribution to historical scholarship today. Pray accept this as a token of my thanks. And with that, I had best return to my studies. Farewell."
