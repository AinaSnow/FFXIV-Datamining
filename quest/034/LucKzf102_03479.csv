The twins weigh heavy on Lanille's mind."
1,"TEXT_LUCKZF102_03479_SEQ_01","After hearing your description of the failed summoning, Lanille is convinced that relations between Phyna and Ciuna are strained, so much so that it has affected their ability to petition the gods. To investigate the source of their conflict, she asks you to speak with the people of Fanow, hoping they will be willing to speak freely with their esteemed guest."
2,"TEXT_LUCKZF102_03479_SEQ_02","You speak with a number of the Viis and learn about Phyna's aspirations of leaving Fanow, as well as Ciuna's dedication to tradition and the protection of their village. Lanille will be glad to hear of what you learned."
3,"TEXT_LUCKZF102_03479_SEQ_03","Your account of conversations with the locals confirms Lanille's suspicions. When the twins arrive and apologize for the day's events, Lanille seizes the opportunity to question them about their recent troubles. The silence of their reply speaks volumes. The cause for their discord is now exposed, but can they reconcile their differences to complete the ritual? "

49,"TEXT_LUCKZF102_03479_LANILLE_000_002","If what you say is true, and not one but two spirits answered their call, it is a sign of disharmony between them."
50,"TEXT_LUCKZF102_03479_LANILLE_000_003","Until we discover its source, attempting the ritual again could prove disastrous."

53,"TEXT_LUCKZF102_03479_LANILLE_000_006","Would you speak with the people of Fanow and see if they know aught of any trouble between Phyna and Ciuna?"
54,"TEXT_LUCKZF102_03479_LANILLE_000_020","It pains me to think they are at odds with one another."
55,"TEXT_LUCKZF102_03479_VIIS03479A_000_021","Phyna and Ciuna? In all of Fanow I can think of no one closer. 'Tis little wonder they were chosen to petition the spirits of the wood."
56,"TEXT_LUCKZF102_03479_VIIS03479B_000_022","In a sense we consider all here to be family, but twins are said to have an especially powerful bond. "
57,"TEXT_LUCKZF102_03479_VIIS03479A_000_023","Which is why it has been so strange to see them argue in recent days. They have not been the same since the Children and Eulmoran soldiers breached the border."
58,"TEXT_LUCKZF102_03479_VIIS03479C_000_024","I spoke with Phyna not long ago. She heard that I was considering leaving Fanow and wished to talk."

I understand the ruins must be protected from the Children, but what difference does one guard make? Phyna shares my feelings on the matter, and has also considered leaving."

68,"TEXT_LUCKZF102_03479_LANILLE_000_040","I see. Phyna yearns to explore the outside world, and Ciuna would remain hidden from it."
69,"TEXT_LUCKZF102_03479_LANILLE_000_041","For as long as I can remember they were inseparable. Phyna's mirthfulness tempered by Ciuna's pragmatism."

75,"TEXT_LUCKZF102_03479_PHYNA_000_046","It will not happen again, I swear it! Please say you will let us try again."
76,"TEXT_LUCKZF102_03479_CIUNA_000_047","Yes, let us try with one of our own and not this outsider. The summoning would have worked if not for <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If>."
77,"TEXT_LUCKZF102_03479_LANILLE_000_048","Enough, Ciuna! The problem lies not with our guest, but with you and your sister. You have been fighting over the future of Fanow, is that right?"
