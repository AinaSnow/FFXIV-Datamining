52,"TEXT_LUCKZE012_03446_KARNES_000_003","If we're ever to rebuild Fort Gohn, something has to be done about the animals that wander about the ruins."
53,"TEXT_LUCKZE012_03446_KARNES_000_004","Which is why I boiled meat in a stew of poisonous mushrooms and snake venom. I was planning to place it around the ruins for the raptors to eat."

55,"TEXT_LUCKZE012_03446_KARNES_000_006","Master Matoya isn't here, and no one ever goes to Fort Gohn, so they'll never have to know. We'll cover the west side of the ruins, you take the east."

57,"TEXT_LUCKZE012_03446_KARNES_000_010","Good, you've finished. Our side is taken care of as well."
58,"TEXT_LUCKZE012_03446_VARTHON_000_011","We should leave before our clothes begin to smell of the stuff."
