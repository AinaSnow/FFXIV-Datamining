Phyna and Ciuna are prepared to fulfill their duty."
1,"TEXT_LUCKZF104_03481_SEQ_01","The bond between Phyna and Ciuna has been mended, and now they are prepared to carry out their duty to the village. They ask you to meet with them at the Morning Stars to once more serve as witness to their petition to the heavens."
2,"TEXT_LUCKZF104_03481_SEQ_02","With hearts as one they pray to the heavens, and no sooner do they finish their incantation than a spirit appears, kissed by thunder. As their witness, it falls to you to slay the spirit and deliver their prayers to the gods."
3,"TEXT_LUCKZF104_03481_SEQ_03","Your battle is quick like a flash of lightning, and with your final blow you bring the ceremony to a most satisfying conclusion. All the while Phyna and Ciuna are beaming with delight."
4,"TEXT_LUCKZF104_03481_SEQ_04","The twins are overjoyed to see the ceremony was a success, a testament to their commitment to both the village and each other. While they would love nothing more than to share the good news with Lanille, they extend that honor to you while they tend to cleaning the altar."
5,"TEXT_LUCKZF104_03481_SEQ_05","The ritual is complete, once more ensuring the protection of the gods. The experience has brought Phyna and Ciuna closer together than ever before, but there will yet come a day when they must part ways. It will not be a day for mourning, however, for though their paths will be separate, they will one day lead to a brighter future for Fanow."
