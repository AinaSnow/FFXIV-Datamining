70,"TEXT_SUBWIL020_00393_LEUCU_002","By no means a resounding victory, but I suppose red it shall be. I have some catalysts I've been saving for just such an occasion. Mark my words: I'm going to concoct the most vibrant red Ul'dah has ever seen!"
71,"TEXT_SUBWIL020_00393_LEUCU_003","Alchemy may look arcane and esoteric to the uninitiated, but it is grounded in naught but science and experimentation. Indeed, I daresay it does more to advance culture and civilization than nigh any other discipline."
