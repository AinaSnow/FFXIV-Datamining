1,"TEXT_GAIUSE501_00363_SEQ_01","As the Scions of the Seventh Dawn have grown in size and influence, so too have their responsibilities, prompting Minfilia to consider if their expansion was wise. Alphinaud, however, does not harbor such concerns, having embraced his role as commander of the Crystal Braves and guardian of Eorzea. The young Elezen now wishes to aid the Immortal Flames in their ongoing efforts to bring stability to Ul'dah, and he would like your assistance with this mission as well. Join him outside the solar and listen to what Riol, his subordinate, has to say."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSE501_00363_SEQ_02","Riol, who has been attempting to trace the source of some weapons wielded by disgruntled refugees, has learned of a large shipment which may be intended for the same purpose. A black marketeer in eastern Thanalan is planning to resell the weapons and reap a tidy profit─unless you and Ilberd intervene before the exchange takes place. Rendezvous with the captain of the Crystal Braves at Highbridge."
