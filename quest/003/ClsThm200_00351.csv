1,"TEXT_CLSTHM200_00351_SEQ_01","Listen to Cocoboha, the second-youngest brother, as he instructs you from the chapter entitled “The Threat of Perplexity.”"
2,"TEXT_CLSTHM200_00351_SEQ_02","You learn of a recent spate of murders perpetrated by a villain known only as the “Mageslayer.” The killer appears to be exclusively targeting thaumaturges, draining them of their aetheric vitality. Head to Nophica's Wells in western Thanalan, and aid Cocobusi in his attempt to track down this seemingly insatiable predator."
3,"TEXT_CLSTHM200_00351_SEQ_03","Cocobusi has bid you examine the remains of the slain thaumaturges. Head into the nearby stream, and see what evidence of the killer can be found."
4,"TEXT_CLSTHM200_00351_SEQ_04","You have recovered a bloody scepter, a shredded tome, and a bloody bracelet from the corpses of the unfortunate mages. Return to Cocobusi, and see what he can determine from the sullied objects."
5,"TEXT_CLSTHM200_00351_SEQ_05","After noting the freshness of the blood staining the items you recovered, Cocobusi believes the killer may yet be lurking nearby. Head back into the stream, and draw out the Mageslayer by using yourself as bait. You nervously hope that the Roegadyn warrior does, indeed, stand ready to leap into the fray!"
6,"TEXT_CLSTHM200_00351_SEQ_06","With the help of the stalwart swordsman, you have succeeded in defeating the trio of imps. Report your success to Cocobusi."
7,"TEXT_CLSTHM200_00351_SEQ_07","Cocobusi laments that a single imp managed to escape the scene of slaughter. Search for the cowardly voidsent in the shaded outcropping to the southeast, and bring your trial to a satisfying conclusion."
8,"TEXT_CLSTHM200_00351_SEQ_08","The true identity of the Mageslayer has been revealed. Return to the Thaumaturges' Guild and report to Cocoboha."
9,"TEXT_CLSTHM200_00351_SEQ_09","Cocoboha, seemingly unaware of his younger sibling's possession, declares that with the successful completion of this lesson's trial, your training with the <Emphasis>Yawning Abyss</Emphasis> is now at an end. Speak with Cocobuki, and learn what is to be done about Cocobusi."
10,"TEXT_CLSTHM200_00351_SEQ_10","Cocobuki appears shaken and dismayed by his confrontation with the voidsent-possessed Cocobusi. He asks that you leave him in peace for a time, that he might consider his next course of action.

※The next thaumaturge quest will be available from Cocobygo upon reaching level 25."
