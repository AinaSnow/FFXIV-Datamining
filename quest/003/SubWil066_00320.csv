2,"TEXT_SUBWIL066_00320_SEQ_02","While Wystan does not require additional escorts for the expedition, he would appreciate your assistance in convincing a group of children from Stonesthrow to stop waiting for him and return home. Offer Wystan's cookies to the children and persuade them to leave."

5,"TEXT_SUBWIL066_00320_SEQ_05","Your confrontation with the Brass Blades is interrupted by a mysterious masked mage, who unleashes a clay golem upon you. In the chaotic battle that ensues, you somehow slay the rampaging construct moments before Thancred arrives."

8,"TEXT_SUBWIL066_00320_SEQ_08","Momodi confirms that Wystan is finished in Ul'dah, but assures you that no one knows of your deeds. Though many would question the wisdom of opposing such powerful forces, she clearly approves of your actions. As a reward, Momodi grants you complimentary accommodation at the Hourglass, and permission to undertake guildleves."
