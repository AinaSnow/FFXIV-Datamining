※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESXMS009_00354_SEQ_01","After thanking you for your hard work across the realm, Amh Garanjy informs you that she has discovered the identity of the grieving child responsible for writing the misplaced letter. The celebrant requests that you speak with the boy, and see what can be done to ease his troubled heart. Take the message, don your Starlight apparel, and seek out Timothey by Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre in Old Gridania.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESXMS009_00354_SEQ_02","You confirm that Timothey was, in fact, the author of the angry letter, but the child storms off before you are able to learn anything more. Show the message to the boy's mother, and listen to what she has to say about their family's woes."
3,"TEXT_FESXMS009_00354_SEQ_03","Timothey's mother lays bare their tragic history. Refugees of the Calamity, it seems that the boy lost some treasured mementos─a pair of bracelets crafted by his departed father─during their long and difficult journey to Gridania. Return to Amh Garanjy in the Lavender Beds and relay the child's tale."
4,"TEXT_FESXMS009_00354_SEQ_04","Upon hearing your recital of Timothey's story, the celebrant once more returns you to your mission of kindness. Travel to the Central Shroud and search the area near the Mirror Planks for Timothey's missing bracelets."

6,"TEXT_FESXMS009_00354_SEQ_06","You still have yet to discover any trace of the dropped bracelets. Continue searching the nearby area."
7,"TEXT_FESXMS009_00354_SEQ_07","As you scour the ground for Timothey's missing bracelets, you are approached by a snowy-haired gentleman in scarlet garb who claims to have found the treasures you seek. The wandering pilgrim explains that he discovered the damaged jewelry by accident, and has repaired them with some minor improvements. Return to Timothey at Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre and deliver the brassy bangles."
8,"TEXT_FESXMS009_00354_SEQ_08","Although initially dubious of the authenticity of the bracelets, your explanation eventually convinces Timothey that the Saint of Nymeia himself had a hand in returning to him his treasured possessions. Return to Amh Garanjy in the Lavender Beds, and tell her of Timothey's joyous transformation."
9,"TEXT_FESXMS009_00354_SEQ_09","After listening to your happy tale, Amh Garanjy is reminded of a similar encounter she had with a snowy-haired pilgrim when she was a young girl. The celebrant believes that that moment of kindness was what set her on her current path, and wonders if the wandering gentleman you both met was not the Saint of Nymeia in truth. Content to believe it to be so, Amh Garanjy urges you to return to your work of gift giving and joy bringing for as long as the Starlight Celebration continues."
