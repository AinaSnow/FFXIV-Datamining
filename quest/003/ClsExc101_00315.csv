4,"TEXT_CLSEXC101_00315_SEQ_04","You have defeated the plainstriders. Return to the Marauders' Guild and report to Axemaster Wyrnzoen."
5,"TEXT_CLSEXC101_00315_SEQ_05","Though you have successfully defended the cargo of produce from the voracious plainstriders, you learn that such incidents will continue so long as Kujata is allowed to rampage unchecked. To fully prepare yourself to defeat the so-called Stampeding Mountain, you must heed Wyrnzoen's advice and commit yourself to your training.

※The next marauder quest will be available from Wyrnzoen upon reaching level 15."

55,"TEXT_CLSEXC101_00315_WYRNZOEN_000_12","The foodstuffs spilled from the overturned wain have attracted all manner of hungry predators.
