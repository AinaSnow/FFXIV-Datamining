175,"TEXT_MANFST209_00343_THANCRED_000_182","Having manifested in the physical realm, primals must consume aether if they are to maintain their presence here. And the stronger they become, the more aether they require."

182,"TEXT_MANFST209_00343_MINFILIA_000_189","These cries serve as a beacon toward which a primal's essence is irresistibly drawn. It is this coming together─or “aetheric coalescence”─which grants the beings physical form."
183,"TEXT_MANFST209_00343_MINFILIA_000_190","Once born, a primal gains strength from its followers' worship. The more numerous and fervent they are, the more powerful their god becomes."

They do this by “tempering” mortals─a process to which you yourself were subjected."
