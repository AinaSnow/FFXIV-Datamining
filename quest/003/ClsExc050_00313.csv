1,"TEXT_CLSEXC050_00313_SEQ_01","Wyrnzoen has instructed you to speak with a fellow marauder to learn the nature of the training you are to undertake. Find Broenbhar in the practice area downstairs."
2,"TEXT_CLSEXC050_00313_SEQ_02","Broenbhar explains that marauders develop strength and precision by splitting rocks with their axes. To try your hand at this traditional training method, head out to the Rogue River in middle La Noscea and speak with Rhotgeim."
3,"TEXT_CLSEXC050_00313_SEQ_03","Rhotgeim bids you shatter the stones she has prepared. Destroy the solid rocks on the bank of the river using the Heavy Swing technique."
4,"TEXT_CLSEXC050_00313_SEQ_04","You have shattered three solid rocks. Report to the waiting Rhotgeim."
5,"TEXT_CLSEXC050_00313_SEQ_05","Rhotgeim bids you shatter yet more rocks. Destroy the solid rocks on the bank of the river with your Heavy Swing ability."

7,"TEXT_CLSEXC050_00313_SEQ_07","Rhotgeim seems pleased with your rock-shattering ability. Return to the Marauders' Guild and report to Axemaster Wyrnzoen."
8,"TEXT_CLSEXC050_00313_SEQ_08","Upon returning to the guild, you learn that Axemaster Wyrnzoen has assigned you to respond to an urgent request from the Red Rooster Stead─a duty that involves slaying murderous megalocrabs. Solkwyb, a veteran conjurer, will aid you in this task. Seek her out within the guild before you depart for lower La Noscea."
9,"TEXT_CLSEXC050_00313_SEQ_09","You speak with the conjurer, Solkwyb, and learn more of the duty that lies ahead. Meet her at the megalocrab nest near the Mourning Widow in lower La Noscea."
10,"TEXT_CLSEXC050_00313_SEQ_10","As you are searching through the megalocrab nest, you are approached by a desperate old man by the name of Neddard. Rush to the aid of his grandson, Sighard, before the boy is slain by the rampaging crustaceans."
11,"TEXT_CLSEXC050_00313_SEQ_11","You have slain the megalocrabs and rescued Neddard's grandson from a grisly fate. After thanking you for saving him, Sighard pleads with you to avenge his parents by slaying the fearsome creature responsible for their deaths. Return to the Marauders' Guild and report the situation to Axemaster Wyrnzoen."
12,"TEXT_CLSEXC050_00313_SEQ_12","You report the outcome of your duty to Axemaster Wyrnzoen. The veteran marauder, however, already appears to have knowledge of the creature that slew Sighard's parents. He commends your desire to seek vengeance on the boy's behalf, but warns that you are currently no match for this territorial monstrosity. Nurture your rage and hone your skills before attempting to grant Sighard's fervent wish.

※The next marauder quest will be available from Wyrnzoen upon reaching level 10."

You approach me with a marauder's strides: determined, unswerving, and bereft of the hesitation that marked our first meeting. I am pleased. The time has come for you to begin a new stage in your training."
49,"TEXT_CLSEXC050_00313_WYRNZOEN_000_2","Now, what sets the axe aside from the gladius or the dagger? It is the raw, unstoppable destruction wrought by its thick, heavy blade. And that overwhelming power can only be properly directed by extraordinary physical strength."
50,"TEXT_CLSEXC050_00313_WYRNZOEN_000_3","Thus we come to the core of this day's lesson. Such strength as a marauder must possess is developed through a traditional method passed down through the generations of the guild. A method that you, too, shall be taught to employ."

53,"TEXT_CLSEXC050_00313_BROENBHAR_000_11","Now, we axe-wielders build strength an' control by splittin' boulders. That's right─our traditional method involves smashin' a rock with yer axe."
54,"TEXT_CLSEXC050_00313_BROENBHAR_000_12","But ye can't use just any ol' swing; ye need to hit the rock just so. Rhotgeim, a fellow marauder, is waitin' just outside the Zephyr Gate, by the bridge over the Rogue River. She'll tell ye how it's done."
55,"TEXT_CLSEXC050_00313_RHOTGEIM_000_20","Greetin's, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>. Ready to split some stone, are ye? I've three nice, hard rocks for ye to build up a sweat on. Don't try nothin' fancy now, just hit 'em with a good, solid, Heavy Swing."

57,"TEXT_CLSEXC050_00313_RHOTGEIM_000_30","That's the way to do it, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>. Now ye've got the idea, why don't ye have at 'em a little harder with that Heavy Swing o' yers? Hold nothin' back."
58,"TEXT_CLSEXC050_00313_RHOTGEIM_000_50","Aye, I can see yer a natural. Me head's still ringin' with the sound o' crackin' boulders. Take yerself back to Axemaster Wyrnzoen and let him know yer ready for somethin' harder."
59,"TEXT_CLSEXC050_00313_WYRNZOEN_000_60","Has the training loosened your muscles and focused your mind, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>?

79,"TEXT_CLSEXC050_00313_WYRNZOEN_000_102","Though no longer a threat to the farmers, you should know that it is unusual for such crabs to be found so near the Stead. By all accounts, the creatures were ousted from their usual feeding grounds by a more fierce beast."
80,"TEXT_CLSEXC050_00313_WYRNZOEN_000_103","The beast of which I speak is a known terror in the lands of La Noscea, ever seeking to expand its territory."
