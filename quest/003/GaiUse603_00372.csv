1,"TEXT_GAIUSE603_00372_SEQ_01","Eager to begin his meeting with Ser Aymeric, Alphinaud puts the Gates of Judgement behind him. Return to Camp Dragonhead and ask Lord Haurchefant where the audience is to be held."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSE603_00372_SEQ_02","After welcoming you with his customary warmth, Lord Haurchefant informs you that Ser Aymeric awaits within the nearby intercessory. Speak with the House Fortemps guard to gain entry to the audience chamber, and announce your arrival to the lord commander."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSE603_00372_SEQ_03","Shortly after greeting Ser Aymeric in the intercessory, you are joined by Estinien, the Azure Dragoon. Owing to his prolonged contact with the Eye, Estinien is able to hear Nidhogg's “voice,” and confirms that the roar that recently shook the heavens was the vengeful wyrm's call to battle. It would appear that Iceheart, if not directly in league with the creature, at least shares Nidhogg's desire to invade the city and lay claim to the Eye.

Swayed by Ser Aymeric's grim prediction of a desolate Coerthas providing a new staging point for the Empire, Alphinaud agrees to aid the beleaguered lord commander. Speak with the young Scion and hear his thoughts concerning the Ishgardians' request."

Nevertheless, Alphinaud seems grateful for this opportunity to bring the nations of Eorzea together as allies once more."

Come! Let us find out what concessions the Holy See is willing to make..."

One of the seven great wyrms."
75,"TEXT_GAIUSE603_00372_ALPHINAUD_000_065","His name features prominently in your nation's history. Though once defeated by the hero Haldrath, the beast is said to have terrorized Coerthas since Ishgard's founding."

81,"TEXT_GAIUSE603_00372_AYMERIC_000_071","But though stout walls and sharp blades may suffice to discourage the heretics, the dragons are another matter. There are individuals within the Dravanian Horde whom an entire company of knights would labor to repel─to say nothing of Nidhogg himself."
82,"TEXT_GAIUSE603_00372_ESTINIEN_000_072","Nor does age rob them of their strength. Through the endless march of years, the dragons endure. Patient. Calculating. Inexorable. You must understand: these creatures do not share our perception of time."
83,"TEXT_GAIUSE603_00372_ESTINIEN_000_073","And that is especially true of the great wyrms─they who spend centuries in slumber only to wake and resume their campaign as if mere hours had passed."

104,"TEXT_GAIUSE603_00372_ESTINIEN_000_094","...Was Nidhogg, aye. He means to hurl his Horde against Daniffen's Collar, and shatter the remaining wards that protect the city."
