1,"TEXT_JOBREL013_00359_SEQ_01","After explaining your relic predicament, Adkin pronounces that he will craft a unique sphere scroll to win himself glory in Master Mutamix's eyes. He supposes that an ink distilled from the regal blood of four beings can contain the power of the materia you propose. The scholar bids you first slay “the king disfigured” in the Wanderer's Palace, and gather the blood it sheds.

7,"TEXT_JOBREL013_00359_SEQ_07","You give the vial of kraken blood to an excited Adkin. All that is left is to obtain the life force of “the king forgotten,” found within the Sunken Temple of Qarn where it is said to animate the very stone statues therein.

However, he lacks for a proper paper and the means to keep the ink adhered to it. Thus, he bids you procure and deliver a high-quality page of perfect vellum and a pinch of perfect pounce.

※Certain ingredients required to craft these items can be obtained by desynthesizing aged goods sold at the Silver Bazaar."
10,"TEXT_JOBREL013_00359_SEQ_10","Delivery of the requested goods seems to agitate Adkin, and he reveals his ink is lacking in the proper consistency and color. However, he also claims that it is complete but for a Bombard core to purify the blood, sacred spring water to suspend the distillation within, and furite sand found near Ishgardian castles to increase aetherial conductivity. Find and deliver all three."
11,"TEXT_JOBREL013_00359_SEQ_11","With every ingredient for both scroll and ink in hand, Adkin triumphantly fashions a Zodiac scroll. He gives it to you with a few words of encouragement on your quest to recreate a legendary arm, all the while crowing that his achievement will bring him all the closer to becoming Master Mutamix's favorite disciple.

※If you have obtained all four items requested by Gerolt, you may return to Hyrstmill to have your Zodiac Weapon forged."
