1,"TEXT_CLSEXC300_00319_SEQ_01","Wyrnzoen informs you that Kujata has been spotted in lower La Noscea. Before seeking to do battle with the rampaging beast, the axemaster bids you first visit Sighard at the Red Rooster Stead."
2,"TEXT_CLSEXC300_00319_SEQ_02","Sighard has once again begged you to slay the beast responsible for the death of his parents. It seems, however, that you will not be alone in the task. Speak with Solkwyb and Broenbhar before leaving the Stead, and enlist their aid for the coming battle."
3,"TEXT_CLSEXC300_00319_SEQ_03","Solkwyb and Broenbhar are both eager to stand at your side as you seek to bring down the Stampeding Mountain. Follow Broenbhar's advice, and track down Kujata by following the beast's trail of destruction."
4,"TEXT_CLSEXC300_00319_SEQ_04","You have found the broken remnants of a pot, but Kujata is nowhere to be seen. Continue following the trail left by him and his pack of rapacious scavengers."
5,"TEXT_CLSEXC300_00319_SEQ_05","You have discovered the shattered pieces of a barrel on the side of the road, but have yet to spot Kujata. Continue following the trail of destruction left behind by the monster and his pack."
6,"TEXT_CLSEXC300_00319_SEQ_06","You have stumbled upon the splintered remains of a crate, but Kujata himself appears to have since moved on. Continue your search for the vile beast and the ravenous creatures that follow him."
7,"TEXT_CLSEXC300_00319_SEQ_07","You have finally caught up with Kujata and ended the murderous aurochs' terrible rampage. Wyrnzoen appears with Sighard and Neddard in tow, just in time to help celebrate your hard-won victory. Sighard is overcome with gratitude. Now that you have freed the boy from his burden of vengeance, he has decided to pursue the path of a hero. All that remains is to speak with your waiting colleagues."
8,"TEXT_CLSEXC300_00319_SEQ_08","Wyrnzoen, Solkwyb, and Broenbhar all applaud the mighty deed you have accomplished. Return to Limsa Lominsa, and speak with the axemaster once more back at the guild."
9,"TEXT_CLSEXC300_00319_SEQ_09","Wyrnzoen, having imparted to you all the knowledge of axecraft that he possesses, bids you venture beyond the teachings of the guild. And once you have attained a new peak of marauder perfection, he hopes you will return to share your discoveries. The world─with all its wondrous and deadly challenges─is yours to explore."
