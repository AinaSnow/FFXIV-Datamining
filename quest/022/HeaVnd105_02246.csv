Yet even with the excision of the wyrm's eyes and their insidious influence, Alphinaud is concerned with how Estinien's spirit has endured the harrowing separation. Make your way to the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly, and inquire with Lucia as to the Azure Dragoon's condition."

Promising that Ser Aymeric will send word as soon as the dragoon awakens, she suggests that you occupy yourself by paying a visit to Count Edmont and his sons. Head to Fortemps Manor with Alphinaud and announce your return to the city."
3,"TEXT_HEAVND105_02246_SEQ_03","After treating you to a hero's welcome, Lord Edmont generously offers you the use of his guest quarters, that you might rest and recover. Alphinaud politely declines, however, begging leave to visit the Temple Knights' infirmary. Follow your young friend to the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly."
