※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESXMS101_02224_SEQ_02","The troubled Baenfaeld explains that he would be glad to provide Collys with the details for her special edition if only they could first fix the old signal bell that is to be the main attraction. He asks that you speak with Hervey, the Adventurers' Guild's best goldsmith, and see how the repairs are progressing. Seek out the artisan near the Ruby Road Exchange in Ul'dah."
3,"TEXT_FESXMS101_02224_SEQ_03","You find Hervey just as he has determined the cause of the bell's refusal to clang. It seems that the clapper has rusted through, and the goldsmith laments that he has not the skills to forge a new one. Acquire a new iron clapper for the signal bell, then return to Hervey with the replacement part.

An <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>iron clapper<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> can be crafted using blacksmithing, or purchased from the market boards."
4,"TEXT_FESXMS101_02224_SEQ_04","You deliver a replacement clapper to Hervey, and he immediately affixes the part. The melody he produces from the repaired bell, however, is not as festive as he had hoped. With the prompting of a passing little helper, the goldsmith decides to have you request a famous composer to modify the Ishgardian soldiers' tune into a more celebratory arrangement. Make your way to Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre in Gridania, and present the signal bell and its accompanying sheet music to Cahernaut."
5,"TEXT_FESXMS101_02224_SEQ_05","You place the bell and sheet music before the discerning eyes of Cahernaut, but the composer is unsure that even his genius can coax an appropriate tone from the signal bell's limited musical range. As you wonder what will become of the festival, you are paid an unexpected visit by a white-bearded man dressed as the Saint of Nymeia. The saint offers to work a seasonal miracle upon the bell, and, after a few moments of metalworking ministrations, hands the newly gleaming instrument back to Cahernaut. The composer, inspired by this display of goldsmithing prowess, soon has the bell's old song arranged into an enchanting melody. Return to Limsa Lominsa, and deliver the Starlight bell─and its rearranged sheet music─to Baenfaeld in East Hawkers' Alley."
6,"TEXT_FESXMS101_02224_SEQ_06","You deliver the Starlight bell to an appreciative Baenfaeld. The contrite celebrant explains that although he has thrown out his original plans in favor of a more child-focused festival, his efforts to purchase wondrous decorations for the bell frame have his head spinning in confusion. Almost as if on cue, you are once more taken aback by an unexpected visit: four costumed little helpers appear, and offer their assistance with the preparations. Still reeling at the experience, Baenfaeld wonders if Hervey's shopping trip will be subject to a similar interruption. Find the goldsmith somewhere in Limsa Lominsa."
7,"TEXT_FESXMS101_02224_SEQ_07","You locate Hervey attempting to procure more decorations, and, as expected, you are visited by four more little helpers. Offering little chance to refuse, the costumed artisans take possession of the restored bell, and rush off to complete the centerpiece of the festival. Hurry back to the Aftcastle, and see what has become of the Starlight bell."
8,"TEXT_FESXMS101_02224_SEQ_08","By the time you return to the Aftcastle, it seems the little helpers' work is already done. The main bell has been returned to a beautifully decorated frame, and the jubilant melody that next rings forth has child and grown-up alike beaming with joy. Speak with Baenfaeld and share his thoughts on the celebration."
9,"TEXT_FESXMS101_02224_SEQ_09","Baenfaeld thanks you again for all you have done, and expresses how glad he is that the festival was saved from the pompous event it threatened to become. The celebrant then assures you that he has promised to provide a full interview to Collys, and vows to continue bringing radiant smiles to the children of Eorzea. Go forth now and enjoy the rest of the Starlight Celebration!"
