1,"TEXT_JOBREL100_02211_SEQ_01","You happen upon Rowena just as two unexpected visitors arrive. The first is an earnest young researcher bearing an urgent request, the second, Gerolt the ale-sodden blacksmith. Wasting no time, the researcher, one Ardashir, declares that he has been conducting research into the creation of artificial life─something he refers to as “anima.” Though all of his trials have thus far ended in failure, he is convinced that the Sharlayans' work on arcane sentries holds the key to success. Before he can continue with his suit, however, Gerolt decries him for his lack of imagination, and wryly suggests fusing the anima with a weapon─a proposal which Ardashir considers a stroke of genius. Never one to miss a chance to turn a profit, Rowena sets about persuading Gerolt to take part in the venture, and before you know it, you too have been roped in to test the finished product. You are to rendezvous with Ardashir and Gerolt in Azys Lla, where the pair will apparently be working."

61,"TEXT_JOBREL100_02211_ARDASHIR_000_012","Together with my master, I have been conducting research into the manipulation of spiritual and aetheric energies in what you call the Near East. Our work has shown that the soul is in fact an agglomeration of a specific type of force. This force defines the quiddity of man and makes us who we are."
62,"TEXT_JOBREL100_02211_ARDASHIR_000_013","While the soul is indeed inimitable, we believe it possible to create a quasi-soul. Thus we turned our attention to anima─the selfsame force which allows individuals to traverse the Lifestream via aetherytes. By infusing a soulstone with the requisite quantities of aether, this force may be harnessed."
63,"TEXT_JOBREL100_02211_ARDASHIR_000_014","Yet after years of research and experimentation, we have naught to show for it but inert husks of stone. We repeated the process again and again, adjusting every element, but the result was always the same. At length, my master declared the project a failure, and turned his thoughts to other matters."
64,"TEXT_JOBREL100_02211_ARDASHIR_000_015","But I could not give up! Not after witnessing the beauty of anima. Not after coming so close. And that is why I have journeyed hither to Eorzea."

67,"TEXT_JOBREL100_02211_GEROLT_000_018","And why? 'Cause the youth of today can't be bothered to do an onze of honest work for 'emselves. No sense o' duty. Things get rough, and ye run fer help, leavin' a trail o' piss in yer wake."
