1,"TEXT_HEAVNY211_02230_SEQ_01","Unukalhai warns that the Warring Triad are stirring, and insists that the time to move against them has come. Being the closest to awakening, the eikon known as Sephirot is to be your first target. Join Unukalhai on the Flagship, Azys Lla's main isle, and await the arrival of your fellow Scions."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNY211_02230_SEQ_02","You rendezvous with Unukalhai, and are joined by Y'shtola, Urianger, and Krile─the latter being the “talented individual” to whom Unukalhai alluded earlier. Having spared no effort in her preparations, the surviving Student of Baldesion swiftly discerns the only feasible way to proceed, and assigns herself the task of disabling Sephirot's shackles. Summon your Echo-blessed companions, and make ready to engage the wrathful god as he awakens from millennia of dream-bound servitude.

Given the Garleans' appetite for Allagan technology, however, Unukalhai warns that you may not have the luxury of time. Tiring of the masked youth's portentous utterances, Krile then challenges Unukalhai to reveal his master's identity, but finds the boy wholly unwilling to eschew his veil of secrecy. Though you say nothing, you cannot help but share her misgivings regarding his true motivations..."
