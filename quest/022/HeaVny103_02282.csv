1,"TEXT_HEAVNY103_02282_SEQ_01","A worried Brother E–Sumi–Yan reveals that the stirring of a hostile presence within the walls of the Lost City of Amdapor has prompted the Twelveswood's elementals to abandon their efforts to cleanse the ruins. Travel to Camp Tranquil in the South Shroud and answer Raya–O–Senna's plea for assistance."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNY103_02282_SEQ_02","Raya–O–Senna bids you delve once more into the Lost City of Amdapor, and banish the entity that has so unsettled the Twelveswood's eternal protectors. Speak with the Wood Wailer Alphene who stands guard at the ruins' entrance."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNY103_02282_SEQ_03","You prevail upon Alphene to unbar the gate to the ancient city of the Amdapori. What new terror has laid claim to its moldering stones? How many times must you cleanse the ruins of this obdurate darkness?

5,"TEXT_HEAVNY103_02282_SEQ_05","Brother E–Sumi–Yan arrives at Camp Tranquil just as you announce your return to Raya–O–Senna. After hearing the tale of your expedition, the Padjals speculate that the animated statues you encountered may have begun to stir when darkness last took hold within the ruins. And when the elementals subsequently entered the city, the Amdapori sentinels likely perceived the purely aetherial beings as voidsent invaders of the kind often employed by the city of Mhach. The incident thus explained, and the defenses safely disabled, the Padjals may now resume the task of returning the ancient city to the embrace of the forest."

60,"TEXT_HEAVNY103_02282_RAYAOSENNA_000_014","Plainly, however, that power is now very much awake. The elementals' panic attests to that. <sigh> Quieting them will be no small task..."

I was all but certain that some seed of the darkness had survived... I could not have been more wrong."

71,"TEXT_HEAVNY103_02282_RAYAOSENNA_000_034","It seems safe to assume that the Amdapori built them to repel the armies of Mhach. Were I to hazard a guess, I would say that the passing of the years has dulled the statues' senses, and that they mistook our friends for aetherial beings of a different order─voidsent of the kind employed by the Mhachi magi. The elementals' arrival would have seemed like an invasion."
72,"TEXT_HEAVNY103_02282_ESUMIYAN_000_035","That would explain much, yes. Voidsent monstrosities and undying guardians of stone... The War of the Magi must have been a conflict of truly terrifying proportions."
