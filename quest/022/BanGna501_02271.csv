0,"TEXT_BANGNA501_02271_SEQ_00","The Vath keeneye seems anxious about something.
※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANGNA501_02271_SEQ_01","The Vath keeneye sent one of his brethren, the Vath farwalker, to Idyllshire with a cartload of goods. His delayed return, however, has left the Vath keeneye fearing the worst. He asks that you travel south toward the Dravanian hinterlands in search of the wayward Vath.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANGNA501_02271_SEQ_02","You find the Vath farwalker, but the reason for his delay is not what you feared. In truth, he was startled by the nearby wyverns and stumbled, knocking over his cart. Still fearful of wyverns nearby, he asks you to search the area for any unbroken cargo that he may complete his delivery."
3,"TEXT_BANGNA501_02271_SEQ_03","You find an unbroken jar amidst the fallen cargo. Carry it back to the Vath farwalker, that he may load it back into his cart."
4,"TEXT_BANGNA501_02271_SEQ_04","The Vath farwalker is overjoyed to see not all of his cargo was destroyed. However, he cannot shake the feeling the Vath keeneye will be displeased to hear he delivered only one jug. Hoping to appease his overseer, he asks you to search for more unbroken jugs."
5,"TEXT_BANGNA501_02271_SEQ_05","You search what remains of his fallen cargo and find one last jug is still intact. Take it back to the Vath farwalker."
6,"TEXT_BANGNA501_02271_SEQ_06","The Vath farwalker thanks you for finding a second jug. Though he can now finish his delivery, he still fears the scolding he is sure to receive upon returning. He recalls the reason you were sent, however, and devises a surprisingly deceptive plan to abate the Vath keeneye's anger. He asks you to tell the Vath keeneye that he was, in fact, assaulted by the Onemind, and that you saved him. He then sets off for Idyllshire, and suggests you think carefully about the story you will tell."
7,"TEXT_BANGNA501_02271_SEQ_07","You relay a fabricated story of the farwalker's rescue, and the Vath keeneye is glad to hear he is safe and sound. As he tells it, there are Vath with links to the Onemind still strong enough to turn them back to the side of the Gnath. Though he worries his brothers may give in to the pull of their still-unbroken bonds, he believes that, with effort, they will one day be truly free."

Yes, very angry. <click> <click> I think a few jugs may still be in one piece. We can deliver the unbroken ones. Will you retrieve them for us?"
