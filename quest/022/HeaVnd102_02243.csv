0,"TEXT_HEAVND102_02243_SEQ_00","Alphinaud is eager to hear what tidings Ser Aymeric has to share."
1,"TEXT_HEAVND102_02243_SEQ_01","It would seem that Ser Aymeric has a favor to ask. Now that Nidhogg is possessed of both of his eyes, the lord commander believes that there is only one being capable of standing against the vengeful shade─Nidhogg's own brood-brother, Hraesvelgr. As such, he would have you escort him to Zenith, and aid him in convincing the great wyrm to stand with Ishgard. Though Alphinaud harbors understandable doubts as to the wisdom of this course, it is plain that Ser Aymeric will not be swayed. Notify the lord commander when you are ready to depart."
2,"TEXT_HEAVND102_02243_SEQ_02","Though Ser Aymeric is ready to ascend Sohm Al, he acquiesces to Alphinaud's suggestion that you first visit Vidofnir at Anyx Trine. Travel to the Dravanian forelands, and speak with the wounded dragon."
3,"TEXT_HEAVND102_02243_SEQ_03","Vidofnir dismisses your concern regarding her injury, but can offer little in the way of hope for your intended audience with her sire. Disheartened but not dissuaded, Ser Aymeric resolves to press on into the Churning Mists."

58,"TEXT_HEAVND102_02243_AYMERIC_000_045","Indeed. With that in mind, I have taken the liberty of dispatching a messenger to inform Mistress Tataru that you will be escorting me to Sohm Al. I confess, I did not provide the exact details of our destination, as they are as yet unknown to me..."
59,"TEXT_HEAVND102_02243_ALPHINAUD_000_046","We will summon Hraesvelgr at Zenith in the Churning Mists. Ere we begin our ascent, however, I think it best that we pay a visit to Anyx Trine."
