※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESVLT201_02218_SEQ_01","The time has come again for House Valentione to embark on its annual quest to honor the late Countess Arabelle and bring love to the peoples of Eorzea. Lisette de Valentione is joined by her familiar cadre of retainers, as well as a new group of mystical companions. These fortune-tellers are purportedly capable of divining a couple's chances of romantic success without failure, washing away the uncertainty that comes with any endeavor of the heart. However, it seems people are somewhat reluctant to know such truths, so Lisette bids you pair up with another adventurer to have your relationship laid bare by the fortune-tellers' divinations. Seeing a pair of companions reveling in the day's festivities may spur others to do the same, bringing the Aftcastle alive with the sounds of inquisitive couples. Lisette tells you to speak to the House Valentione emissary nearby to begin your preparations.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
