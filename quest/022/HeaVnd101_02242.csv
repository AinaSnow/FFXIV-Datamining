1,"TEXT_HEAVND101_02242_SEQ_01","According to the knight, Alphinaud wishes to speak with you. Enter Fortemps Manor and find out what young Master Leveilleur has to say."
2,"TEXT_HEAVND101_02242_SEQ_02","Alphinaud bids you recall the events which unfolded at the peace conference─specifically, the moment when Nidhogg appeared in the guise of Estinien. Believing that the preservation of your friend's corporeal form may offer hope for the dragoon's salvation, he has sought the opinion of Y'shtola and Krile. In response to his request, it appears that they have already journeyed to Ishgard to share their observations. Make your way to the Forgotten Knight and speak with Krile."
3,"TEXT_HEAVND101_02242_SEQ_03","At the tavern, Y'shtola and Krile relate their experiences at the conference, concluding at last that Estinien's spirit may indeed have survived, having apparently been enveloped but not consumed by Nidhogg's vengeful will. Heartened, Alphinaud speculates that removing the great wyrm's eyes from the dragoon's armor could potentially free him. Waving away Krile's concerns regarding this dubious proposition, the young Scion declares that he will do whatever it takes to save his friend. In the wake of this impassioned oath, Honoroit appears and announces that Ser Aymeric has requested your presence. Rendezvous with Alphinaud at the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly in readiness for your audience."
4,"TEXT_HEAVND101_02242_SEQ_04","You join Alphinaud outside the Seat of the Lord Commander. Alphinaud's musings echo your own as you ponder the reason behind Ser Aymeric's summons..."

It was a sight to chill the soul─but one which gave me reason to hope that our friend might not be beyond salvation. When you described his fateful transformation at Azys Lla, I feared him lost forever, but the mere fact that some semblance of his former self endures must surely count for <Emphasis>something</Emphasis>. Alas, I have no evidence to support this impression..."
