1,"TEXT_BANGNA504_02274_SEQ_01","Goblins have requested a variety of herbs to be used in the filter of their masks. Because they requested so many, however, the Vath keeneye has decided to split up the work.

He explains that the Vath have not yet grown accustomed to the peculiar look of goblin masks, and cannot help but laugh at the sight of them. Rather than offending his client, he asks that you take them over in his stead."
