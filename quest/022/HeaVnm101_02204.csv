The villains do not take kindly to the interruption, but before they can make good on their threats of violence, they are again interrupted by the arrival of a sky pirate by the name of Redbill Leofard. Leofard quickly dispatches the would-be cargo robbers, and remarks upon the serendipity of meeting the very hero with whom he had hoped to speak. If you would grant the pirate the audience he desires, seek out his crew's standard in the north of the Blue Window."

She leads you to the crew's base of operations, and you learn of their plans to board a massive derelict airship seemingly adrift in the Sea of Clouds. After agreeing to accompany the Redbills on their expedition to this “ghost ship,” Stacia suggests meeting with the crewmate in charge of tracking the elusive vessel. Head to the Gauntlet, and speak with Utata."
