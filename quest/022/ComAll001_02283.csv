It seems that you have been invited to participate in a new military exercise─a war game designed to test the mettle of only the most battle-hardened adventurers. Board the ferry from the Moraby Drydocks in lower La Noscea, and report to Captain Loetahlsyn at the Wolves' Den."

Appealing to your savage side, the Maelstrom officer urges you to participate in the Den's newest war game─the Feast. Speak with the captain again if you wish to learn more."
