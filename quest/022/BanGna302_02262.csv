1,"TEXT_BANGNA302_02262_SEQ_01","The Vath keeneye is perplexed by a recent request from Tailfeather: herbs to be smoked for recreational purposes. Hoping you might have a better appreciation for this unusual custom, he asks that you travel to the Smoldering Wastes to gather three herb sprouts for the hunters.

Unfamiliar with this use of herbs, he insists you deliver them, lest he embarrass himself. The two hunters who requested these herbs, Loupard and Grimold, can be found at Tailfeather."

He fails to understand why hunters would use them, describing the herbs as foul smelling. Should anyone request these herbs again, he intends to warn them of their potential hazards."

49,"TEXT_BANGNA302_02262_SEARCHER_000_001","They say inhaling smoke has a pleasing effect, but we do not understand. Smoke is for driving away dragons or vermin. This use of smoke seems very strange. Yes, much too strange."
50,"TEXT_BANGNA302_02262_SEARCHER_000_002","We do not understand, but you are a fleshling too. You understand this practice of smoke breathing, yes? <click> <click> This is why we ask that you gather the hunters' herbs."
51,"TEXT_BANGNA302_02262_SEARCHER_000_003","You can find herb sprouts in the Smoldering Waste, but we do not need many. Three herb sprouts will do nicely. Yes, very nicely."

53,"TEXT_BANGNA302_02262_SEARCHER_000_011","Yes, yes. This will do nicely. Now, what did the fleshlings say to do? <click> <click> First, dry them with fire shards, like so. Then chop into fine pieces, and... There, it is done."
54,"TEXT_BANGNA302_02262_SEARCHER_000_012","All that remains is delivery. Might I ask that you take them their herbs? We think it better they receive packages from one who understands this smoke breathing."

58,"TEXT_BANGNA302_02262_LOUPARD_000_025","Back when the Sharlayans were still here, they cultivated the stuff in their conservatories. After they packed up and left, though, the plants made their way into the wilds and, well, here we are."

60,"TEXT_BANGNA302_02262_GRIMOLD_000_031","You're a lifesaver, truly. I was beginning to think they'd forgotten. Truth be told, their stock isn't very good, but beggars can't be choosers. The merchants who pass through here would easily charge three times as much for something only marginally better."
61,"TEXT_BANGNA302_02262_GRIMOLD_000_035","I thought about growing my own, maybe even turning a little profit. Then I remembered where the stuff grows, out in the heart of the Smoldering Wastes, and thought better of it."

63,"TEXT_BANGNA302_02262_SEARCHER_000_041","Ahem. Excuse us. We were curious of this smoke breathing and wished to try it. Learning new fleshling customs is usually helpful, but this we are not so sure. Smoke is too smelly. Yes, much too smelly. It clings to clothing and shell, and incites terrible coughing."
64,"TEXT_BANGNA302_02262_SEARCHER_000_042","Perhaps we used too much smoke? Hmmm...we are not sure. <click> <click> We must remember to warn hunters of terrible smell and coughing."
