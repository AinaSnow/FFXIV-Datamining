※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANGNA301_02261_SEQ_01","Not long ago, hunters from Tailfeather put in a request for melia branches, a pliable wood perfect for making arrows. The Vath keeneye asks that you venture out into the Smoldering Wastes in his stead. Marking your map with three locations known to be melia budding grounds, he asks that you slay any meliae you find and collect their branches.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."

3,"TEXT_BANGNA301_02261_SEQ_03","The Vath keeneye is more than happy with the branches you provide him. As an aside, he tells you of his offer of nanka eggs to the hunters of Tailfeather, in addition to the branches they requested. Though his intentions were pure, he was surprised at the hunters' reaction. It would seem the Vath keeneye has much to learn of the likes and dislikes of other races. "
