Mogek the Marvelous is flitting back and forth, a dissatisfied frown on his plump features."
1,"TEXT_BANMOG104_02293_SEQ_01","The baskets Mogek ordered have yet to arrive, and he is afraid he will be left without any means to transport the heaps of fabrics soon to be completed. While he awaits the first of these shipments, Mogek asks that you go and investigate the reason why the baskets have yet to turn up. Travel to the Sohm Al summit and speak with one of the basket-weaving moogles.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANMOG104_02293_SEQ_02","The moogle explains to you, with perhaps a tad too much enthusiasm, that the reason he has fallen behind is because he is having trouble harvesting sankchinni shoots─the main material used to create their wares. He asks that you go and harvest three."
3,"TEXT_BANMOG104_02293_SEQ_03","You quickly find and gather three of the sankchinni shoots you promised the apprentice basket weaver. Return to the Sohm Al summit and deliver them to him."
4,"TEXT_BANMOG104_02293_SEQ_04","As you prepare to return to Mogek with a report, the novice weaver stops you to ask for one final favor. He requests you to synthesize a few basic basket components, which will serve to accelerate the pace at which the weavers can construct baskets. Once you are finished, he asks that you see they are delivered to the managing moogle.

※In the event you lose the materials or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with mendicant moogle."
5,"TEXT_BANMOG104_02293_SEQ_05","You fulfill the young moogle's final request by delivering the basket-weaving components to the Mogmender in charge of overseeing the project. With the help of the items that you crafted for them, he is certain he will be able to finish all of the baskets Mogek requires a bit more quickly. Return to Bahrr Lehs and report to Mogek the Marvelous."
6,"TEXT_BANMOG104_02293_SEQ_06","Mogek is crestfallen to hear that his projected estimates were off by so much. He decides he must use this opportunity to revise his expectations and mitigate any further repercussions this delay might cause."
