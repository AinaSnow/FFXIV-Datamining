Mogek the Marvelous gazes at the sky, an exasperated sigh on his lips."
1,"TEXT_BANMOG302_02299_SEQ_01","Tharl Oom Khash contains some of the purest crystals in the realm, and Mogek, eager to get a hold of some, has sent Mogmenders to procure several chest-loads of these gleaming marvels. However, with their consignment now long overdue, Mogek's patience is wearing thin and, unable to contain his frustration, he bids you investigate the cause of this delay.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANMOG302_02299_SEQ_02","Upon entering the ruins, you are greeted by a moogle who expresses his relief that you're here. He goes on to explain that a number of his crew has been struck down, overwhelmed by the vast amounts of aether being emanated from the crystals around them. Believing he will be able to see their harvested crystals safely back to Mogek if he can shield the few remaining moogles from their adverse effects, he asks that you fashion an aetheric shielding for their chests. Synthesize the requested items and deliver them to the malaised moogle.

※In the event you lose the materials or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with the muddled moogle."
3,"TEXT_BANMOG302_02299_SEQ_03","The moogle you hand the aetheric shielding to is beginning to feel dizzy─a telltale sign of aether sickness. He is concerned that if his condition worsens, he will be unable to deliver the crystals he promised Mogek. Upon handing him the shielding you synthesized, however, he perks up, a great deal more confident he can handle the situation."
4,"TEXT_BANMOG302_02299_SEQ_04","Mogek the Marvelous feels responsible for the complications that arose in Tharl Oom Khash. He tells you of how moogles are especially sensitive to aether and laments the fact that he failed to take this into account before sending his Mogmenders to a cave steeped with it."

50,"TEXT_BANMOG302_02299_MOGEK_000_002","They should have returned by now, with chests overflowing, kupo. The reason they haven't, I imagine, is because they have run into trouble. <sigh> Great adventurer, might you go and see what the problem is?"

53,"TEXT_BANMOG302_02299_DIGGINGMOOGLE02299_000_012","While this puts us in a tenuous position, a few of us have yet to feel its full effects. If we proceed with caution, we might still be able to fulfill Mogek's request!"

66,"TEXT_BANMOG302_02299_MOGEK_000_041","We moogles are more adept at manipulating our aetheric flow than most. However, as this is less an acquired skill and more a natural talent, we are more like to succumb to overexposure."
67,"TEXT_BANMOG302_02299_MOGEK_000_042","While there is no denying this was an unfortunate turn of events, I am happy to see that the Mogmenders appear, at least, to be learning the value of hard work!"
