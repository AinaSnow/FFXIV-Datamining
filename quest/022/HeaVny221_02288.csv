Urianger expresses puzzlement at the apparent ease with which the imperial forces dispelled his ward, but Unukalhai is in no mood to explore this mystery, urging you to seize the opportunity to eliminate the intruders. Krile duly uses a nearby terminal to open a direct path to the core laboratories, where the secrets of Allag are stored..."

6,"TEXT_HEAVNY221_02288_SEQ_06","In an effort to excuse his uncharacteristically rash behavior, Unukalhai tells you of a star which met its end through the abuse of primal energies. This, he claims, is why it is imperative that those who would use primal-harnessing technologies are stopped by any means necessary.
