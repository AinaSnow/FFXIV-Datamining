※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANGNA503_02273_SEQ_01","After greeting you in a most unusual manner, the Vath keeneye tells you of yet another request from the goblins. As always, their appetite for nanka eggs is endless, and he would ask you help fill their most recent order. To lure out nankas heavy with eggs, he says you will need to retrieve bait from a trap set up north in the waters of the Hundred Throes.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."

3,"TEXT_BANGNA503_02273_SEQ_03","No sooner do you place the shrimp down in the water than two nankas appear. You dispatch them quickly and procure an ample number of nanka eggs. Return to Loth ast Vath and deliver the eggs to the Vath keeneye."
4,"TEXT_BANGNA503_02273_SEQ_04","The Vath keeneye is grateful for your assistance, and thankful the Gnath do not hunt nanka eggs to make matters worse. He tells you that, unlike the Vath, the Gnath eat the same dreary food every day. All the more reason he and his brethren are glad to be free of the Onemind, able to make decisions for themselves."
