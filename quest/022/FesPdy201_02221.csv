※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESPDY201_02221_SEQ_01","You stop when a news reporter from the <Emphasis>Mythril Eye</Emphasis> asks you for your candid opinion on the newly formed ensemble, the Songbirds, scheduled to perform at the coming Little Ladies' Day festival. Upon confessing your ignorance, he reveals that the group's rise to stardom hasn't been as smooth as was expected and that most of the realm remains unaware of their existence. Sensing your curiosity may be piqued, the reporter suggests you go and speak with the royal seneschal at the Ruby Road Exchange.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."

I'm a reporter from the <Emphasis>Mythril Eye</Emphasis> and am interviewing adventurers such as yourself for an exclusive feature on Little Ladies' Day. Might I borrow but a moment of your time to ask a few questions?"
49,"TEXT_FESPDY201_02221_REPORTER02221_000_001","Fantastic! As you may have heard, the Songbirds─a trio of talented pre–teen troubadours─are headlining this year's festival. Tell me, what do you think of them?"

51,"TEXT_FESPDY201_02221_REPORTER02221_100_002","Well, you wouldn't be the first. While the girls have been hard at work trying to liven up the festivities, it would seem their efforts have gone largely unnoticed."
52,"TEXT_FESPDY201_02221_REPORTER02221_000_003","Ever since the esteemed F'lhaminn retired, no star of noteworthy ability has come to grace the stages of Ul'dah. We at the <Emphasis>Mythril Eye</Emphasis> have been following their story in hopes that the Songbirds would be able to fill that void she left behind."
53,"TEXT_FESPDY201_02221_REPORTER02221_000_004","Were they to catch fire, it would serve to bolster the city–state's economy but, as it stands, they are still relative unknowns."
54,"TEXT_FESPDY201_02221_REPORTER02221_000_005","This is the extent of my knowledge, but if you're interested in learning more, I'm sure the royal seneschal would be happy to oblige. Seeing as he's in charge of organizing the festivities, you should be able to find him at the Ruby Road Exchange."

67,"TEXT_FESPDY201_02221_BUTLER_000_021","You see, there are few who are aware of the Songbirds' existence and fewer still who will attend performances. Time is running out and we are nowhere closer to gaining recognition from the good people of Ul'dah than when we first began."
