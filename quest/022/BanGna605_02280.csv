1,"TEXT_BANGNA605_02280_SEQ_01","Mourn has been overrun by pesky dinosaurs, and the Adventurers' Guild is asked to find a way to reduce their numbers. Deciding it to be the safest course of action, the Vath keeneye sends the Vath braveheart to steal their eggs. What was to be a quick job has resulted in the braveheart disappearing for days and now the keeneye needs someone to find─and possibly rescue─his friend. Travel to the caverns of Mourn and look for the braveheart.

5,"TEXT_BANGNA605_02280_SEQ_05","Your last trek through the caves seems to have given you a good idea on where to find the dinosaur eggs and you are quick to locate another one. Pick it up and deliver it to the Vath braveheart."
6,"TEXT_BANGNA605_02280_SEQ_06","The Vath braveheart is very upset that the Vath keeneye did not disclose to him all the necessary details before having him embark upon this mission. In a trembling voice, he claims that he will be staying behind in the caverns of Mourn with the beasts he so fears as a form of protest."
7,"TEXT_BANGNA605_02280_SEQ_07","The Vath keeneye is stunned and insulted to learn that the Vath braveheart believes him to be unworthy of managing their Adventurers' Guild. He shakes his head and tells you that running an organization is a great deal more difficult than he had ever expected it to be."
