※Changing classes or jobs will prevent progress during this quest."
1,"TEXT_JOBREL101_02212_SEQ_01","Ardashir hopes to begin work on the anima weapon as soon as possible. All the necessary elements are in place save two: astral and umbral nodules, the catalysts required to facilitate the process of channeling aether into the soulstone. Unsure of where to procure them, Ardashir suggests speaking with Rowena in Revenant's Toll. With any luck, she will know of a merchant who can provide what he needs.

※You may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_JOBREL101_02212_SEQ_02","Hearing of your need for crystals with unusual properties, Rowena suggests speaking with a merchant by the name of Syndony. She is a jeweler who also happens to be quite knowledgeable about crystals. You can find her on the terrace of the second floor in the House of Splendors."
3,"TEXT_JOBREL101_02212_SEQ_03","Upon speaking with Syndony, it soon becomes clear that your reputation has preceded you. When you inquire about the nodules, she is taken aback by your outlandish request, but is not deterred from the challenge of producing what you seek. The process will require elementally aspected luminous crystals, and she insists you bring her one of every element. However, she also believes there may be one other way: bringing her a Zodiac Weapon of the highest order. Seeing your nonplussed expression, she concedes that such a legendary weapon may be no more than a rumor.

※Should you be unwilling or unable to offer a suitable Zodiac Weapon, luminous crystals can be obtained by participating in FATEs in the following regions:
- Sea of Clouds: luminous wind crystals
- Azys Lla: luminous fire crystals
- Churning Mists: luminous lightning crystals
- Coerthas western highlands: luminous ice crystals
- Dravanian forelands: luminous earth crystals
- Dravanian hinterlands: luminous water crystals"
4,"TEXT_JOBREL101_02212_SEQ_04","With the nodules in hand, Ardashir is at last ready to go through with Gerolt's plan. He duly completes the infusion of aether, and hands the pulsating soulstone to Gerolt, who immediately sets about affixing the radiant gem to your weapon. Some time later, the sweating smith finally lowers his hammer, a look of both exhaustion and satisfaction on his face. The plan has succeeded and you are the proud owner of an anima weapon. Now begins the journey to discover its full potential."
