His plan to have Jiromaru distribute rice cakes to the masses and thus improve relations between man and blessed beast, however, has encountered cyclopean-sized difficulties.

The saru bugyo then expresses his intention to continue with the mochi making for the duration of Heavensturn, and hopes that you are still inclined to assist with the unusually dangerous chore of mochi retrieval..."
