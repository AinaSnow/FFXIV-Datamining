1,"TEXT_CHREND201_02207_SEQ_01","Briardien tells you that while change has come to Ishgard, ill-feeling between the low- and highborn yet festers, with tensions rising by the day. The inspector is convinced that the recent hostilities are the result of a carefully laid plot conceived to further the interests of a party or parties unknown. Though he has yet to discover what their ultimate aim might be, he is not without a plan. Certain that the unexplained disappearances of Ulaa and volume eleven of the <Emphasis>Articles of Halonic Polity</Emphasis> are somehow related to the scheme, he declares his intent to find the missing girl by tracking down the missing book. While he continues to search for the tome, Briardien bids you inquire as to whether the students have heard anything concerning Ulaa's whereabouts or, failing that, observed any unusual goings-on."
2,"TEXT_CHREND201_02207_SEQ_02","You speak with the students of the scholasticate, who are mostly preoccupied with their studies or else talking amongst themselves. As you continue making your rounds, however, it becomes clear that not everyone is present, and that two pupils in particular are notable by their absence. Ask Father Saturnois if he knows where Theomocent and Leigh might be."
3,"TEXT_CHREND201_02207_SEQ_03","Father Saturnois reveals that ever since Theomocent and Leigh learned of Ulaa's disappearance, they have devoted all of their energies to finding her, determined that she should resume her studies. With this apparently in mind, they begged leave to travel to Gorgagne Mills, and duly received it."
4,"TEXT_CHREND201_02207_SEQ_04","You arrive at the abandoned settlement to find Theomocent and Leigh kneeling in prayer. At your approach, the former rises to greet you, and reveals that Gorgagne Mills is the resting place of the boys' late mentor, Father Choisseau. He goes on to explain that the two of them often visit the grave when they are feeling lost or uncertain. Interpreting your unexpected arrival as a sign from on high, the two students seem satisfied that their time has been well spent, and resolve to return to the scholasticate forthwith. Follow in their footsteps, and report their deeds to Father Saturnois."
5,"TEXT_CHREND201_02207_SEQ_05","Upon learning what his two best pupils were doing in the western highlands, Father Saturnois seems wholly unsurprised, acknowledging that Theomocent and Leigh had always held the man who raised them close to their hearts. Far from feeling misled, he is pleased to see that their feelings for Father Choisseau are as strong as ever, and heartened by the concern they have shown for their fellow students."

Both she and it, after all, were passionate advocates of equality among men."

Well then─let us be about it!"
