1,"TEXT_SUBCTS809_01424_SEQ_01","Tatafu's seasick courier being otherwise occupied, you have been charged with delivering cargo to Nanalai in Crescent Cove. You know not to tarry, for these burlap sacks large and small are eagerly awaited."
2,"TEXT_SUBCTS809_01424_SEQ_02","It turns out the sacks contained soil and seeds that will aid Nanalai in becoming a farmer. As wild as the scheme seems, the soon-to-be former fisher struck you as no fool. Now, hurry back to Vesper Bay, for Tatafu is owed payment for the merchandise."
3,"TEXT_SUBCTS809_01424_SEQ_03","Tatafu is dubious of the fisherman's chances, but admits to knowing little of the farming trade. While the same could be said of you, you cannot help but find your thoughts wandering back to the extra seeds you were given, and the idea of a small garden all your own..."

50,"TEXT_SUBCTS809_01424_TATAFU_000_002","Hired this big lug to make the deliveries, but what I got instead are a couple of chum pails badly in need of emptying."

55,"TEXT_SUBCTS809_01424_NANALAI_000_012","What will I do with this soil? Put it on the ground, that's what. The littler bag you gave me is filled with seeds. It's time for some farming!"

59,"TEXT_SUBCTS809_01424_TATAFU_000_020","Swiftly done! Was the fisher satisfied with his bits of land?"

63,"TEXT_SUBCTS809_01424_TATAFU_000_024","Got to have hope, right? Here, that's some leftover seeds for you. If you come into a bit of land in one of those adventurer districts, go on and set up a vegetable patch or two."
