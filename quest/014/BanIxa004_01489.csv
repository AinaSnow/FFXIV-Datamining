※The crafting portion of this quest is recommended for Disciples of the Hand level 6 and above."
1,"TEXT_BANIXA004_01489_SEQ_01","After explaining the need for certain notoriously difficult-to-acquire materials, Tataramu reluctantly asks that you deliver a letter to an acquaintance of his. Visit the airship ticket counter in Gridania, and ask Hida where you might find a gentleman by the name of Colson.

4,"TEXT_BANIXA004_01489_SEQ_04","After delivering the letter to Advisor Colson, you learn that Tataramu is actually the “missing” son of Highwind Skyways chairman Tatabaru. Though vexed by the unapologetic nature of Tataramu's brief missive, Colson nevertheless agrees to cover the costs for the young Lalafell's requested materials. Take the promissory note and hand it to Hildeyerd at the Fallgourd Float crafting facility."
5,"TEXT_BANIXA004_01489_SEQ_05","You hand the promissory note to Hildeyerd, and receive what the workshop supervisor describes as a set of lavishly expensive materials. Use the facility to craft a high-quality engine jointing component, then deliver your handiwork to Tataramu.
