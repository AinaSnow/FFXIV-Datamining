As ablest of Ixal, Yazel Ahuatan has a reputation to maintain.
※The crafting portion of this quest is recommended for Disciples of the Hand level 1 and above, and the battle portion for Disciples of War or Magic level 41 and above."
1,"TEXT_BANIXA103_01496_SEQ_01","The recent loss of starboard hull component materials has placed Yazel Ahuatan in a precarious position. So that none may have cause to doubt his ableness, recover the materials his courier abandoned when attacked by Ixal in Treespeak.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANIXA103_01496_SEQ_02","After a brief skirmish, the materials are yours. However, returning the materials will not suffice to redeem Yazel Ahuatan. Visit the crafting facility at Treespeak Stables, and present the component materials to Nellemond, so that you may use the facilities to construct the requisite components."
3,"TEXT_BANIXA103_01496_SEQ_03","You have handed over the component materials to Nellemond, and gained access to the crafting facility. Synthesize two starboard hull components, and deliver them to Yazel Ahuatan at Ehcatl.

※In the event that the status <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Facility Access: Finishing<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> wears off or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Nellemond."
4,"TEXT_BANIXA103_01496_SEQ_04","The squa-hawk which echoes throughout Ehcatl is one of ultimate relief, as Yazel Ahuatan's comrades no longer have cause to doubt his competence. Maintaining an image as an able Ixal can be difficult at times, but the adulation of Ixali maidens more than justifies the effort─or so Yazel Ahuatan would doubtless say, if the question were put to him."
