2,"TEXT_BANIXA003_01488_SEQ_02","You find the missing Bozol Eduan in Alder Springs, the exhausted Ixal cradling what appears to be a broken arm. No sooner has Bozol warned you to leave, however, than his tormentors─a group of Ixal from the logging grounds─appear to further threaten and taunt him. Wary of your presence, perhaps, the fanatics withdraw after pronouncing an ominous ultimatum. Speak with Bozol, and listen to the unfortunate engineer's tale."

5,"TEXT_BANIXA003_01488_SEQ_05","You have delivered the propulsion engine component to Sezul. The Ehcatl Nine leader is thankful for your efforts, but laments the delay caused by his chief designer's injury. Upon hearing of this predicament, Tataramu offers to shoulder Bozol's duties, and convinces Sezul that his dedication to the project is genuine.
