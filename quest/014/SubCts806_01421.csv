1,"TEXT_SUBCTS806_01421_SEQ_01","You are a tad fuzzy on the details, but, with a wink and a nod, Wiscard has sent you off to deliver a leather bag to Rowena. You can only hope that his promises of newfound performance and fashion have merit."
2,"TEXT_SUBCTS806_01421_SEQ_02","You have conveyed the bag and Wiscard's well-wishes to Rowena, with explosive results. Try to think happy thoughts as you hasten back to the flamboyant trader."
3,"TEXT_SUBCTS806_01421_SEQ_03","Wiscard practically writhes in ecstasy at Rowena's loathing, proving that one truly does create one's own reality. He presents you with a glamour prism, which has the power to make one object look like another. Now you, too, can look the part of a successful adventurer!"
