1,"TEXT_GAIUSD017_01412_SEQ_01","Urianger informs you that the Mogglesguard have once more succeeded in calling forth the daunting avatar of Good King Moggle Mog XII. Make your way to the Adders' Nest in Gridania, and report to High Serpent Commander Vorsaile Heuloix."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSD017_01412_SEQ_02","In somewhat pained tones, Vorsaile Heuloix explains how Kuplo Kopp attempted to chastise the Mogglesguard for their previous folly in summoning the king. Unfortunately, Kuplo's words did not have the desired effect─fueled by fear and righteous indignation, the Mogglesguard proceeded to summon an even more potent incarnation of their maniacal monarch. Make haste to the Bramble Patch in the East Shroud, and rendezvous with your frantic moogle acquaintance."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSD017_01412_SEQ_03","Kuplo Kopp has called upon you to depose “Great” King Moggle Mog XII, and to give the Mogglesguard a sound thrashing. Enter Thornmarch through the nullified ward, and defeat this royal menace!
