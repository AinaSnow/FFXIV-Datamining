1,"TEXT_JOBREL004_01464_SEQ_01","Hubairtin has offered to prepare as many sphere scrolls as you desire, so long as you furnish him with the required quantity of superior enchanted ink. Having explained the materia-infusion process in detail, the young arcanist bids you report to Jalzahn at Hyrstmill in the North Shroud, that the wizened alchemist might lend his formidable knowledge to the cause."
2,"TEXT_JOBREL004_01464_SEQ_02","Jalzahn is impressed by Hubairtin's ingenuity, and expresses confidence that he will be able to finish what the young arcanist has started. For now, it falls to you to fully infuse the sphere scroll. If you would wield a mightier relic, see the deed done, then present the scroll to Jalzahn.

※Each materia infusion requires the use of alexandrite, a catalyst yielded from treasure coffers whose locations are marked on <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>mysterious maps<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>.
※Mysterious maps can be obtained from Auriana at Revenant's Toll in exchange for Allagan tomestones, or by completing a certain quest. Alexandrite may also be obtained by participating in FATEs while equipped with your relic weapon (animus or beyond).
※The enhancement process will raise your relic weapon animus's strength, dexterity, vitality, intelligence, and mind attributes to a value befitting gear of item level 110. Attributes that remain will be replaced with the ones infused into the sphere scroll. In the case of Thyrus Animus and Omnilex Animus, base direct hit rate will not be replaced."
