2,"TEXT_SUBPST001_01482_SEQ_02","Pleased to receive good tidings, Miounne shares with you the story of two Lalafells befriended by her grandfather in days gone by. Father and daughter, they overcame initial ostracism to raise a great waterwheel that still stands as a symbol of Gridania to this day. Miounne would visit the wheel with you, but before that asks that you pick four carline blossoms from around town."

5,"TEXT_SUBPST001_01482_SEQ_05","Miounne shares with you the touching tale of Figaga, the Lalafellin girl who saw her stricken father's dream to fruition. Through passion and force of will, she became a master builder and raised the great waterwheel that now bears her name...before she tragically succumbed to the same illness that took her father. Miounne pays her respects at this brave woman's final resting place before returning to the Carline Canopy, named for Figaga's favorite flower. Join her there, that she might share with you the rest of the story."
6,"TEXT_SUBPST001_01482_SEQ_06","Back at the Canopy, Miounne explains how she converted the old cabin into the establishment it is today to carry on the spirit of her dear departed grandfather, who spared no effort in welcoming the various peoples who came to Gridania seeking a new home. It is in this same spirit that she accepted her current position with the Adventurers' Guild. Miounne reflects upon her fated meeting with you, and expresses her joy and anticipation at the many meetings with new adventurers that yet lie ahead."

75,"TEXT_SUBPST001_01482_MIOUNNE_000_045","People laughed─who was this shy little girl with yellow blossoms in her hair? But within a year's time, all could see that the girl was a prodigy with a hammer. In five years, she had mastered skills that would take an ordinary carpenter a lifetime. In ten, her father's dream had become a reality."

78,"TEXT_SUBPST001_01482_MIOUNNE_000_048","Though she is with us no more, she remains an inspiration for the women of Gridania, myself first among them. It is here, in view of the father and daughter's greatest accomplishment, that I buried their ashes and built a small monument to their memory."
