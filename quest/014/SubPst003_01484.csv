Unwilling to take no for an answer, the would-be suitor enlists your aid in seeking out the man who crafted Momodi's prized hairpin, in hopes of proving himself superior to any of his beloved's old flames. Rendezvous with Thomas at the Goldsmiths' Guild to begin the search."

It was crafted by Momoroto, a once-promising young artisan who abandoned his craft and left Ul'dah behind for reasons unknown.

Return to Momodi and see how she fares."

She further explains that she took on her current position in the Adventurers' Guild out of a desire to be a guiding hand to all those who would dream of serving the realm, and that she wears Momoroto's hairpin as a reminder of what can happen if well-meant words of encouragement are carried too far. Moved by Momodi's rousing speech, Thomas vows to find a dream of his own, one that might at last win him the admiration and affection of his beloved."
