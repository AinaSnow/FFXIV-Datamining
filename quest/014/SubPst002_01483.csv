Your mission, whether or not you choose to accept it: take the letter in hand and deliver it to Baderon, proprietor of the Drowning Wench."
2,"TEXT_SUBPST002_01483_SEQ_02","Your delivery a successful one, Baderon wastes no time in enlisting your services as an adventurer. It would seem a notorious individual has resurfaced after an extended absence, and the proprietor would seek your help in seeing old debts repaid. He urges you to speak with S'dhodjbi before setting out to find this potentially dangerous individual."
3,"TEXT_SUBPST002_01483_SEQ_03","S'dhodjbi surmises that the man in question is an old foe from Baderon's former life as a sellsword. She affords you a special gift that she believes will serve you well in your encounter with the Roegadyn ruffian who awaits you in middle La Noscea."

6,"TEXT_SUBPST002_01483_SEQ_06","A brief parley with the ruffian reveals his name as Tylswaen. To your surprise, he is not an old foe of Baderon's, but rather a comrade─a fellow sellsword who incurred Baderon's ire not for crimes committed, but merely for his drunken debauchery. Tylswaen explains that he has returned with a gift for his old friend─a gift that he promptly left behind at Summerford Farms when he departed in a stupor. Venture there in the Roegadyn's stead and speak with Staelwyrn, that you might recover what has been lost."
7,"TEXT_SUBPST002_01483_SEQ_07","Less than pleased at the mess the drunkard left behind, Staelwyrn nevertheless explains that Tylswaen's belongings like as not may still be found in his room. Go and retrieve them, taking care not to step in any foul spew that the drunkard left behind."

10,"TEXT_SUBPST002_01483_SEQ_10","Beneath his gruff exterior, Baderon appears heartened at the long-overdue reunion with his erstwhile comrade. Tylswaen explains that the matching coins were a memento from a mutual acquaintance, a veteran sellsword who guided the two new recruits all those years ago. Though S'dhodjbi still wonders what compelled Baderon to give up the old life, it would seem that must remain a tale for another day. In the meantime, the deputy postmoogle will be eager to learn that your training mission was a success."
