As you converse, you overhear three Brass Blades discuss their attempt to capture a fugitive beastman wreaking havoc in the streets. Could this be related to the kidnappings you are investigating? Seek out the beastman in question and find out."
3,"TEXT_BANALL060_01472_SEQ_03","The fugitive beastman was revealed to be your erstwhile comrade, Yadovv Gah of the Brotherhood of Ash. He swears that the rumors of violent attacks against innocent Ul'dahns are lies, and that he came to the city in pursuit of a man who abducted his brothers. Sylvie appears, offering to lead the troubled Amalj'aa safely out of the city walls. Before departing, Yadovv Gah informs you that he and his warleader will await you at the Ring of Ash."

The warleader's honor will not allow him to sit idly by. Realizing that the two of you share a common foe, he enlists your aid in seeing that the perpetrator answers for his treacherous acts."
