The guildmaster also reminds you that Eorzea is apparently full of big fish for a self-improving fisher to hone his skill on. Word is that rare fish will fetch a handsome price in equipment at Revenant's Toll, unless you prefer to consume several dozen servings of a lemon herb Old One on a bed of spinach."
