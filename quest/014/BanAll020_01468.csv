Convinced that the touched sylphs that inhabit the Sylphlands are responsible for the deed, Voyce begs you to travel to the entrance to their lair in the East Shroud, and stand lookout in hopes of catching the abductor in the act."

Return to Voyce and inform him that you will have to look elsewhere for the kidnapper."
