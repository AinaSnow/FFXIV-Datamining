※The crafting portion of this quest is recommended for Disciples of the Hand level 1 and above."
1,"TEXT_BANIXA002_01487_SEQ_01","Sezul has marked you for a skilled artisan, and requests that you craft for him an airship hull component─a specialized item which the Ehcatl camp lacks the resources to build. Make your way to Fallgourd Float and obtain the necessary crafting materials from the Qiqirn junkmonger.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANIXA002_01487_SEQ_02","After handing you the component materials, the junkmonger advises that you make use of the crafting facility found beside the Bobbing Cork. Head over to the workshop and hand the materials over to Hildeyerd."

Her explanation, however, is interrupted by a young Lalafellin man, who insists on appraising the results of your apparently doomed endeavor. Use the materials returned to you by Hildeyerd to craft the interior hull component, and then show the item to the waiting Tataramu.

After recovering from his shock at the quality of your work, the young man demands to know the identity of your client.

Return to Ehcatl and deliver the component to Sezul."
5,"TEXT_BANIXA002_01487_SEQ_05","No sooner have you placed the component into Sezul's hands than Tataramu bursts into the camp and accuses the chief of sullying the field of airship engineering. The Ehcatl Nine leader explains, however, that his purpose in breaking away from the Garuda-beholden Ixal was to begin construction on the <Emphasis>Dezul Qualan</Emphasis>─a hybrid vessel intended not to wage war, but to soar above the highest clouds. Quickly convinced by Sezul's obvious zeal and sincerity, Tataramu then begs for a position on the chief's ambitious project.
