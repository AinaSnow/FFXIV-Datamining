1,"TEXT_SUBCTS814_01463_SEQ_01","As Kokosamu tells it, Master Mutamix has developed a method for combining multiple pieces of unneeded materia to give them new form and life─a procedure known as transmutation. He encourages you to speak with the esteemed goblin scholar, that you might enlighten yourself as to the specifics."
2,"TEXT_SUBCTS814_01463_SEQ_02","While the precise process of materia transmutation is too complex to be imparted to a layman, Mutamix generously offers to perform the procedure whenever you so desire. To take the goblin up on his offer, you need only bring him five pieces of unwanted materia."

49,"TEXT_SUBCTS814_01463_KOKOSAMU_000_001","Well, <Emphasis>I</Emphasis> have, and I tell ye, it felt like I'd brought a sack full o' fishin' poles to a gold mine. Now, I ask ye: what if there were a way to melt down a couple pieces of materia that weren't availin' you naught, and mold them into a shiny new piece that─Nymeia willin'─just might strike yer fancy?"
50,"TEXT_SUBCTS814_01463_KOKOSAMU_000_002","Now, if yer as sharp as I reckon ye are, ye can already see where I'm headin' with this. Aye, that's right─thanks to Master Mutamix, now ye can do just that! Or at least, Master Mutamix can do it for ye."

Uplander seeks knowings of shifty-making, yes? Then uplander should make openears to tongueflaps of Mutamix."

55,"TEXT_SUBCTS814_01463_MUTAMIX_000_022","Shkohhh! But shifty-making is not simple like crafty-making. Knowings of shifty-making are much and many, and uplander's braincase─though big for uplander─is small."
56,"TEXT_SUBCTS814_01463_MUTAMIX_000_023","Uplander need not be making worry-face. If uplander has many need-not materia, bring them to tent-ring. Mutamix will shifty-make for uplander!"
