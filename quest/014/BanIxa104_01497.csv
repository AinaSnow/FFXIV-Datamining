An able Ixal keeps able allies close, and Yazel Ahuatan the Able prays you are one such <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If>.
※The crafting portion of this quest is recommended for Disciples of the Hand level 1 and above, and the battle portion for Disciples of War or Magic level 41 and above."
1,"TEXT_BANIXA104_01497_SEQ_01","While transporting a shipment of larboard hull component materials to Ehcatl, one of Yazel Ahuatan's carriers was waylaid by Gridanian forces. To ensure that the construction of the <Emphasis>Dezul Qualan</Emphasis> continues as scheduled, you have been asked to retrieve the component materials. Should the Ehcatl Nine carrier yet live, you will likely find him in hiding. If so, with the chat mode in <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Say<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>, enter the password “With the Wind” to identify yourself as a friend.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANIXA104_01497_SEQ_02","You find the carrier alive and well, and retrieve from him the component materials. Alas, simply completing the delivery will not suffice, as the components themselves are urgently needed. Visit the crafting facility at Treespeak Stables, and present the component materials to Nellemond, so that you may use the facilities to construct the requisite components."
3,"TEXT_BANIXA104_01497_SEQ_03","You have handed over the component materials to Nellemond, and gained access to the crafting facility. Synthesize three larboard hull components, and deliver them to Yazel Ahuatan at Ehcatl.

4,"TEXT_BANIXA104_01497_SEQ_04","Your unexpected display of initiative surprises the able Yazel Ahuatan, who expresses his delight with a requisite squa-hawk. Thanks to your efforts, he will be held in even higher esteem by his comrades, for able is the Ixal served by able subordinates."
