2,"TEXT_GAIUSE309_01450_SEQ_02","You find Papalymo waiting for you at the Goldleaf Dais. Before you can exchange more than a few words with him, however, a fearsome denizen of the forest crashes into view, and you are forced to defend yourself. Needless to say, you have faced worse, and the creature is soon subdued. With the coast apparently clear, resume your conversation with Papalymo."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSE309_01450_SEQ_03","You speak with Papalymo, but find his manner to be oddly stilted. Plainly, he is not quite himself. Return to Maxio and share your suspicions."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSE309_01450_SEQ_04","Maxio believes that the touched sylphs are using an enchantment to disguise themselves as your fellow Scions. Accordingly, he provides you with scalebombs that will nullify their illusory magicks. Throw the trueform scalebombs at Papalymo and Yda's doubles, and defeat the devious dissemblers."
5,"TEXT_GAIUSE309_01450_SEQ_05","You have defeated the touched sylphs who were masquerading as Yda and Papalymo. Report your success to Maxio."

7,"TEXT_GAIUSE309_01450_SEQ_07","You locate Yda and Thancred, but have no way of knowing if they are who they seem to be...save one. Make use of the trueform scalebombs given to you by Maxio, and defeat any tricksters you reveal."
8,"TEXT_GAIUSE309_01450_SEQ_08","Though your scalebombs have no effect on Yda─besides affront and discomfort─they do serve to unmask the sylph posing as Thancred. With the impostor out of the way, you may now speak freely with your fellow Scion."
9,"TEXT_GAIUSE309_01450_SEQ_09","It would seem that Yda had no inkling of the touched sylph's deception, nor does she know where the real Thancred might be. Give the exasperated pugilist a moment to think before discussing how best to proceed."
