In order to prevent the pillaged goods from supplying the bloody schemes of the Coral Tridents, the spawnling asks that you set fire to the pitch-caulked chests of the tattooed thugs. Borrow an elbst from his clutchmate Pahh, and use the small flint stone to strike sparks aboard the Reavers' ship."

He is adamant that a continued campaign of such sabotage will do much to impede the warmongering Sahagin and their antagonistic actions."
