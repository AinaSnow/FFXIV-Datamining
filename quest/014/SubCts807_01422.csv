1,"TEXT_SUBCTS807_01422_SEQ_01","Wiscard confides that there are energies at work in every action, which constrain him from seeking payment for a very valuable skill he would teach you. But of course, you are happy to perform a small errand for him in return, and deliver a letter to Rowena."
2,"TEXT_SUBCTS807_01422_SEQ_02","Rowena receives the message with ill grace. Her facility for curses is impressive, but you are left wondering why anyone would fall into arrears with this daughter of the Fury. Your ears still ringing with invectives, return now to Wiscard."
3,"TEXT_SUBCTS807_01422_SEQ_03","From Wiscard's reaction, you get an inkling of what all this talk of energy exchange might mean, and ponder over public persona and private predilections. Rather than go down this primrose path, it might be best to simply purchase whatever tomes from Tataroga you find desirable; only then can you learn the master crafting recipes held within..."
