1,"TEXT_GAIUSE319_01460_SEQ_01","Slafborn informs you that the preparations for the inaugural ceremony are almost complete. He is concerned, however, that Tataru yet seems buried under a mountain of small details. Head into the Rising Stones and offer your aid to the harried receptionist."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSE319_01460_SEQ_02","Tataru appears overjoyed at your offer of help, and wastes no time in assigning you a task. Track down the recruits waiting around Revenant's Toll, and present them with their new uniforms."

After taking his place before the assembled─and newly garbed─recruits, Alphinaud launches into an impassioned speech. He reiterates their mission to protect Eorzea, and at last reveals the name he has chosen for the trial company: the Crystal Braves. As the cheers die down, Minfilia congratulates Crystal Brave Commander Leveilleur on the culmination of his hard work. Speak with the Antecedent and discuss what is to come."
5,"TEXT_GAIUSE319_01460_SEQ_05","Though enthusiastic about the formation of the Crystal Braves, Minfilia's jubilance is muted by a grave concern─the prolonged silence of the Mothercrystal. After confirming her suspicions, the Antecedent realizes that Hydaelyn has spoken to neither of you since the final battle with the Empire.
