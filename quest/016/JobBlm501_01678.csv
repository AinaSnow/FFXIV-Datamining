1,"TEXT_JOBBLM501_01678_SEQ_01","Lalai has stumbled upon an enciphered parchment among Ququruka's effects which reveals the whereabouts of tomes of magic thought to have been long lost─the Books of Nald'thal. As the <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If> who has inherited Ququruka's legacy, Lalai believes that these tomes and the secrets they hold rightly belong to you. She bids you meet her at Nald's Reflection in southern Thanalan, there to search for the Book of Nald."
2,"TEXT_JOBBLM501_01678_SEQ_02","You have successfully retrieved the Book of Nald. Proceed now to Thal's Respite in eastern Thanalan and look for its twin, the Book of Thal."
3,"TEXT_JOBBLM501_01678_SEQ_03","You arrive at Thal's Respite only to find that the Book of Thal is no longer there. Lalai is determined to recover the tome before the secrets it holds can be used to cause great harm. Return to Milvaneth Sacrarium and speak with Lalai to deliberate on a course of action."
4,"TEXT_JOBBLM501_01678_SEQ_04","Evidence at the crime scene indicates that the Book of Thal was removed from its hiding spot but recently. As the tome is protected by an enchantment as its twin is, Lalai believes that there is still time to avert disaster. She expresses her intent to make discreet inquiries as to the location of the missing tome, and asks your permission to hold on to the Book of Nald for a thorough examination.

※The next black mage quest will be available from Lalai upon reaching level 52."

49,"TEXT_JOBBLM501_01678_LALAI_000_001","After Master Ququruka passed away, I went to his cell in the Marasaja Pit─the cell in which he spent a hundred years locked away."
50,"TEXT_JOBBLM501_01678_LALAI_000_002","I doubted my master, and the guilt of it gnaws at my conscience. In order to atone, I decided to preserve the fruits of his research for future generations."
