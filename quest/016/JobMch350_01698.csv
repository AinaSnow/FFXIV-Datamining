1,"TEXT_JOBMCH350_01698_SEQ_01","Stephanivien is, as ever, excited about the future prospects of machinistry. A sudden visit from his father, however, serves to illustrate the difficulties the chief machinist faces in his attempts to subvert Ishgard's traditional way of thinking. After apologizing for subjecting you to his family squabble, Stephanivien then invites you to join him in eastern La Noscea, where he hopes to find a part for his latest invention. Speak with Rostnsthal in Raincatcher Gully, and continue your instruction in the machinist trade."
2,"TEXT_JOBMCH350_01698_SEQ_02","Though obviously unhappy about the trek out to the gully, Rostnsthal sees the material-gathering expedition as a fine opportunity to test the extent of your improvement. Speak with Stephanivien, and defend him from any threats that arise."
3,"TEXT_JOBMCH350_01698_SEQ_03","You succeed in slaying the hostile wildlife that swarm the crash site, but it seems that Stephanivien is no closer to locating the part he has come to find. Speak next with Joye, and protect her while she continues picking over the wreckage."
4,"TEXT_JOBMCH350_01698_SEQ_04","Joye is appreciative of your assistance with the aggressive wildlife, but her efforts have also failed to uncover the elusive magitek component. Return to Rostnsthal and hear his evaluation of your marksmanship abilities."
5,"TEXT_JOBMCH350_01698_SEQ_05","Almost immediately after Rostnsthal praises your improvement with firearms, you are forced to dispatch a rampaging goobbue. Oddly enough, the bullet-ridden corpse of your foe yields what appears to be a functioning piece of Garlean technology. Show the magitek part to Rostnsthal."
6,"TEXT_JOBMCH350_01698_SEQ_06","Rostnsthal looks over the offal-covered piece of machinery, but can make neither heads nor tails of it. Take his advice, and hand the component over to Stephanivien."
7,"TEXT_JOBMCH350_01698_SEQ_07","You hand over the magitek component, and the chief machinist lets out a jubilant shout─it would seem that the gyroscope you recovered was the very part for which he had been searching. Return in triumph to the Skysteel Manufactory, and speak once more with Stephanivien."
8,"TEXT_JOBMCH350_01698_SEQ_08","Still giddy with delight at your serendipitous discovery, Stephanivien informs you that the completion of his prototype is now but a matter of time. While the inventor works on his new creation, however, it seems Rostnsthal would have you master a new firearm skill...

※The next machinist quest will be available from Stephanivien upon reaching level 40."

51,"TEXT_JOBMCH350_01698_STEPHANIVIEN_000_003","'Tis called “machinistry,” Father. And you need not come at all if the air in the workshop so offends you."
