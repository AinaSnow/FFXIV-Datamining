1,"TEXT_JOBBLM600_01683_SEQ_01","Lalai was recently approached by Zhai'a Nelhah, who announced that he had discovered the Defiant's base of operations before departing in a rush. It seems that the cultists lurk at the Burning Wall in eastern Thanalan. Hurry there with Lalai and meet with Zhai'a Nelhah before he attempts to confront them himself."
2,"TEXT_JOBBLM600_01683_SEQ_02","You rendezvous with Lalai, but see no sign of Zhai'a Nelhah. Lalai fears that he attacked the Defiant alone. It makes no difference. You have no choice but to descend the Burning Wall and search for Waldeve."
3,"TEXT_JOBBLM600_01683_SEQ_03","In the deepest depths of the Burning Wall, you encounter Waldeve. In defiance and desperation, he calls forth a great horror from the beyond. Knowing that his powers alone are insufficient─and despite Lalai's warnings of the inherent danger─he plans to control this monstrous voidsent such that all will fall in worship of him. Before he can enact his ghastly plot, Zhai'a Nelhah appears...and with reinforcements! Kazagg Chah, Dozol Meloc, and 269th Order Mendicant Da Za arrive to lend their strength, wisdom, and support. Waldeve's plan fails when, as predicted by Lalai, the voidsent turns on him, defeating him in an instant. This unspeakable, dangerous beast cannot be allowed to escape the Burning Wall. Slay it.

With the threat of the voidsent resolved, Zhai'a Nelhah steps forward to heal the grievous and brutal wounds that it inflicted upon Waldeve. The criminal is taken away into custody by Zhai'a Nelhah, who asks you to wait for him at Milvaneth Sacrarium, where he intends to thank you formally for your assistance in his investigation. Confer with Lalai."
4,"TEXT_JOBBLM600_01683_SEQ_04","Lalai decides to return to Ul'dah immediately. She suggests you do the same, but not before you speak with Kazagg Chah, Dozol Meloc, and 269th Order Mendicant Da Za, who assisted you in the battle. This is a valuable opportunity to renew your friendship with these powerful allies."
5,"TEXT_JOBBLM600_01683_SEQ_05","You thank the beastmen for their support. The bond you share with these noble magi will not be easily broken. Lalai still waits for you at Milvaneth Sacrarium. Return there and speak with her."
6,"TEXT_JOBBLM600_01683_SEQ_06","With Waldeve under arrest and awaiting sentencing by the Padjals, Zhai'a Nelhah returns to Milvaneth Sacrarium to give you his thanks for your assistance and the Book of Thal, which he recovered from Waldeve. Your actions in the recent battles with the Defiant have shown Zhai'a Nelhah the value of black magic when wielded with wisdom and prudence, and in aid of a noble goal. He hopes that, by entrusting the tome to Lalai's care, he can one day see an age of cooperation between healing and destructive magic.

※The next black mage quest will be available from Lalai once you have met the following requirements:
※ You must have registered a product key for FINAL FANTASY XIV: Stormblood to your service account.
※ You must have completed the main scenario quest “The Far Edge of Fate.”"
