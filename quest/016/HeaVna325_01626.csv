1,"TEXT_HEAVNA325_01626_SEQ_01","To your frustration, Moghan insists that with the winds blowing as they are, Hraesvelgr is unlikely to be found at Zenith. It would seem you have no choice but to make yourself comfortable, and wait for the weather to turn. Join the moogle in the clearing to the southeast of the wyrm's palace, and inquire if there is anything you can do to make the time pass more quickly."

But though shared adversity has brought you closer together, tensions yet simmer between Estinien and Ysayle. You can only hope that tomorrow's negotiations will bring a final resolution to their─and Ishgard's─conflict..."
