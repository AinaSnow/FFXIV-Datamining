1,"TEXT_HEAVNA506_01647_SEQ_01","Alphinaud suggests that you seek the support of the Zundu in slaying Bismarck and petition Chief Sonu for an island to bait the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis>'s hook. Present your proposal to the chieftain and see what he says."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNA506_01647_SEQ_02","Swayed by Alphinaud's impassioned denunciation of Bismarck as a false savior, Chief Sonu declares that you will have your island. Inform Cid that you have fulfilled your part of the bargain."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNA506_01647_SEQ_03","Cid's preparations have proceeded smoothly, and the required chains and ballistas have already been delivered to the Sea of Clouds. You need but notify Wedge when you have assembled your party of brave companions, and you will be ferried to the island provided by the Zundu."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNA506_01647_SEQ_04","You inform Wedge that you are ready to hunt the white whale. Board the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> with your companions and rid the Sea of Clouds of Bismarck's ravenous presence.

5,"TEXT_HEAVNA506_01647_SEQ_05","You execute Cid's bold plan to perfection, and the Lord of Mists falls like so many before him. Soon after, the long-silent voice of Hydaelyn resounds in your mind once more, though you must strain to make out Her words. Alas, it fades as quickly as it came, and you are left to wonder at Her intent..."
6,"TEXT_HEAVNA506_01647_SEQ_06","Prize in hand, you turn towards the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis>, only to find Igeyorhm and Archbishop Thordan barring your path. After wresting the key from your grasp, the Ascian observes that you have regained the blessing of Light─albeit at a fraction of its former strength. Retrieving the key, the archbishop casts it heavensward, and the Allagan relic emits a beam of light pointing the way to Azys Lla. The pair then depart aboard the <Emphasis>Soleil</Emphasis> as you, still weak from your struggles against Bismarck and Igeyorhm, can only watch, powerless to stop them."
7,"TEXT_HEAVNA506_01647_SEQ_07","After you disembark from the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis>, thoroughly downcast, Alphinaud assures you that all is not lost. Though the archbishop has claimed the key to Azys Lla, you yet live to give chase. Scant consolation, perhaps...but true nonetheless. Having all but placed the prize in your enemy's hand, you are fortunate to have a chance at redemption. It is time to put away self-pity, and steel yourself for the task ahead."

53,"TEXT_HEAVNA506_01647_ALPHINAUD_000_011","Hear me, Chief Sonu. This creature which torments you now is not the deity who raised up the floating isles and made a gift of them to you."
54,"TEXT_HEAVNA506_01647_ALPHINAUD_000_012","He is a perversion of your beliefs given form by the Vundu─a false savior who consumes that which he should rightly safeguard."
55,"TEXT_HEAVNA506_01647_ALPHINAUD_000_013","Yet it need not be this way, Chief Sonu. We have the power to strike down this impostor...but we must beg of you an island to see it done."

74,"TEXT_HEAVNA506_01647_ALPHINAUD_000_041","Would that I could fight alongside you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, but primal influence being what it is, I think it best that I assist Wedge with the machinery on this occasion."
75,"TEXT_HEAVNA506_01647_CID_000_042","Since we still don't know the extent of Bismarck's influence, I'd prefer to keep those not actively participating in the battle inside the ship. It would be a shame if one of us started chanting “The White! The White!” and stabbed you in the back, after all."

77,"TEXT_HEAVNA506_01647_ALPHINAUD_000_050","Forgive me, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Had I known what was happening, mayhap I could have done something to stop them..."
78,"TEXT_HEAVNA506_01647_ALPHINAUD_000_051","Alas, Wedge and I were still sealed within the engine room and heard naught of the struggle until it was over."
79,"TEXT_HEAVNA506_01647_ALPHINAUD_000_052","And now, for all our efforts, the archbishop holds the very thing we sought to keep from him..."
80,"TEXT_HEAVNA506_01647_ALPHINAUD_000_053","But all is not lost, for we yet live, and we know their destination! Let us give chase and bring an end to their machinations!"
81,"TEXT_HEAVNA506_01647_CID_000_060","In retrospect, we should probably have seen that coming. Still, you fought well, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>─better than that, in fact. Chin up, eh?"
82,"TEXT_HEAVNA506_01647_WEDGE_000_061","I didn't know Alphinaud had been studying magitek technology. He was a godssend during the fight, the way he helped me tend to the engines."
