1,"TEXT_JOBMCH400_01699_SEQ_01","Stephanivien is excited to share with you the completion of his latest invention, but his enthusiasm is soon dampened by the arrival of his father. It would seem that Svara, a dragon of great size and ferocity, is en route to Skyfire Locks─a collection of redoubts that House Haillenarte is honor-bound to defend. In response to Lord Baurendouin's dire need for reinforcements, Stephanivien pledges the participation of the manufactory's machinists. Speak with the chief machinist and discuss what is to be done."
2,"TEXT_JOBMCH400_01699_SEQ_02","With the majority of his machinists untested in battle, Stephanivien decides to entrust the use of his prototype to you. He asks that you employ the autoturret in the defense of Skyfire Locks, and demonstrate to Lord Baurendouin the full extent of machinistry's effectiveness."

That contraption at your waist will convert your body's aether into the lightning-aspected energy required to power the turret. You need simply to activate the weapon, and it will supplement your own attacks."
