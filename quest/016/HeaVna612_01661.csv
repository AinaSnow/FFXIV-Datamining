1,"TEXT_HEAVNA612_01661_SEQ_01","After a moment's reflection, Matoya deciphers the contents of the tome, that Cid might avail himself of her research and build the aetheric ram. However, the question of an energy source remains. Even as you mull over the dilemma, Alphinaud has an epiphany: the Eye is a boundless source of aether! ...But will Estinien relinquish it? Ask Alphinaud how he means to proceed."
