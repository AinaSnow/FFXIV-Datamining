1,"TEXT_JOBSCH560_01674_SEQ_01","Surito Carito reveals his latest theory: the voidsent bound within the amphora unleashed the sickness upon Nym, and fled from its cage after cloaking itself with dark magicks. He says you must track down this invisible voidsent, but that even a scholar of his experience needs time to discover where to start. In the meantime, he asks that you and Alka Zolka focus on training, and introduces Halga Tolga to guide you. Speak with this former officer of the vaunted Nymian Royal Marines near Bronze Lake, and start learning things the hard way."

Now, he bids you prove that you have the courage of one by finding the leader of the Mamool Ja to the east of Bronze Lake. Mock him and his ways with a great big /laugh, and defend yourself if he should take exception to your actions."

Focus on honing your own skills, he orders you, and you may be able to defeat the invisible voidsent. Someday.
