1,"TEXT_HEAVNA302_01603_SEQ_01","Conscious that Tataru should have a say in how to proceed, Alphinaud proposes that the three of you hold a council. Join your fellow Scions at the manor entrance, and signal to Alphinaud that you are ready to begin."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNA302_01603_SEQ_02","As you discuss the possibility of enlisting Iceheart to mediate with the dragons, you are approached by Estinien, Ishgard's famed Azure Dragoon. He insists on accompanying you to the proposed parley with Nidhogg, and Alphinaud warily consents, on the condition that he stay his lance until words have proven ineffective. Before you can begin your mission, however, you must first convince Ser Aymeric to forestall any military action that might jeopardize your negotiations. Make your way to the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly, and speak with the sentry on duty to be admitted to the Seat of the Lord Commander."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNA302_01603_SEQ_03","Though troubled by your refusal to share the details of your plan, Ser Aymeric agrees to use his influence to keep the See's more vociferous crusaders in check. Ask Alphinaud what he intends to do next."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNA302_01603_SEQ_04","Though Ser Aymeric has granted you a measure of time to enact your plan, the Horde will invade the moment its forces are assembled. Conscious of this, Alphinaud immediately sets his sights on the next objective: locating Lady Iceheart."
