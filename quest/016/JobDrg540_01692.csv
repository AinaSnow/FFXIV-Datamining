1,"TEXT_JOBDRG540_01692_SEQ_01","Ser Alberic informs you that the dragon Graoully and his horde are advancing on Ishgard, and Heustienne is preparing to meet them in the field. Alas, with the majority of her fellow dragoons absent, she can muster only a token force of defenders, and so Ser Alberic bids you lend your lance to the mission. Make haste to the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly and join Heustienne ahead of her departure."
2,"TEXT_JOBDRG540_01692_SEQ_02","Your offer of aid is received by Heustienne with thanks, and by her father with relief. After his daughter leaves, Montorgains asks that you watch over her, lest her desire to distinguish herself in battle cloud her judgment. Having given him your assurance, make now for the western highlands of Coerthas and rejoin your fellow dragoons."
3,"TEXT_JOBDRG540_01692_SEQ_03","You arrive to find the battle already raging, with the dragoons incurring heavy losses. Together with Heustienne, you succeed in repelling the remaining enemy forces, but their leader, Graoully, is conspicuous in his absence. Just when it seems the dragon will not appear, his menacing shadow falls over you. Heustienne impulsively leaps at Graoully, piercing his hide with her lance, and you and Brucemont can only look on helplessly as she is borne away. Speak with Brucemont and see if aught can be done."
4,"TEXT_JOBDRG540_01692_SEQ_04","Brucemont does not mince words: he is not hopeful of Heustienne's survival. He entrusts to you a fragment of her armor, broken off in battle, and bids you see it to her father's hands at the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly."
5,"TEXT_JOBDRG540_01692_SEQ_05","You deliver the fragment of armor to Montorgains in lieu of the tragic news, but he refuses to believe that Heustienne is gone. Upon hearing your account of events, he dares to hope that his daughter is still alive. Ser Alberic swears to do all in his power to find her, and bids you meet him at the Observatorium to deliberate a course of action."
6,"TEXT_JOBDRG540_01692_SEQ_06","Alberic fears that Heustienne may have been taken deep into Dravanian territory, but he is determined to rescue her. While he tracks Graoully's movements to ascertain Heustienne's location, dedicate yourself to honing your lance arm, that you may be ready for the trials to come.

※The next dragoon quest will be available from Alberic upon reaching level 56."
