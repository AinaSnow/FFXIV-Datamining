1,"TEXT_HEAVNA332_01633_SEQ_01","Alphinaud asks that you return to Ishgard to check on the progress of the manacutter while he coordinates the ongoing search efforts with the remaining Crystal Braves. Make your way to the Skysteel Manufactory and speak with Cid."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNA332_01633_SEQ_02","Though confounded by your uncannily perfect timing, Cid is happy to announce the near-completion of the manacutter prototype. Whilst he and his employees make the final adjustments to their latest creation, he bids you visit Fortemps Manor, where Estinien awaits."

Having listened to your plans, the lord commander eagerly offers his own blade for the battle ahead, forcing Estinien to remind him of his duties as the city's protector. No sooner has Ser Aymeric relented than Alphinaud moves to declare <Emphasis>his</Emphasis> determination to join you, only conceding defeat after some typically candid words from the Azure Dragoon. Inquire as to Estinien's reason for denying your fellow Scion his wish."
5,"TEXT_HEAVNA332_01633_SEQ_05","Estinien acknowledges Alphinaud's potential, but believes the task of defeating Nidhogg will be challenging enough without the need to carry an inexperienced ally.
