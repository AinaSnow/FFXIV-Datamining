2,"TEXT_HEAVNA322_01623_SEQ_02","You speak to each of your companions in turn, and inform them of Chieftain Moglin's impending announcement. Return to the center of Moghome, and notify the moogle leader that everyone is ready to hear him pass judgment."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNA322_01623_SEQ_03","Chieftain Moglin somewhat sheepishly admits that your trials were nothing more than a convenient distraction─a means to keep you and your companions occupied while the moogles repaired the horn required to summon Hraesvelgr. It would seem the mere presence of Kuplo Kopp was enough to dispel any doubts the chieftain may have had regarding your intentions. Trouble Moghan for his thoughts on these questionable proceedings."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNA322_01623_SEQ_04","Moghan guiltily thanks you for your hard work, but deflects all the blame for the deception onto Chieftain Moglin. Though some of your companions are less than impressed with their treatment at the hands of the moogles, you now have a destination to aim for─Zenith."
