2,"TEXT_HEAVNA701_01663_SEQ_02","You find Y'shtola in uncommonly good cheer─in stark contrast to Estinien, who seems to take her positivity as a personal affront. As you look on bemused, a tense exchange ensues in which Y'shtola warns Estinien that the Eye will consume him given the slightest opportunity. Of course, the dragoon is having none of it. As he strides off, Urianger arrives bearing a gift of white auracite, found among Moenbryda's last effects, thus rounding off your unexpectedly eventful errand. Rejoin Alphinaud at the airship landing."

As promised, the newly installed aetheric ram makes short work of the Allagan barrier, but you have no time to celebrate, as an imperial battleship appears in your wake and opens fire. Hopelessly outmatched, you prepare for the end, only to spy Ysayle riding to the rescue upon Hraesvelgr's back. Transforming into Shiva, she engages the enemy battleship single-handed, and succeeds in incapacitating it at the cost of her own life.

When you subsequently arrive in Azys Lla, you say a silent prayer for the allies who have paid the ultimate price that you might fight on."
