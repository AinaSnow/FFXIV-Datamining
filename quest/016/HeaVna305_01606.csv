1,"TEXT_HEAVNA305_01606_SEQ_01","Upon learning that the Akh Afah Amphitheatre may yet harbor your quarry, Alphinaud suggests employing the swiftest means of travel available─the aetheryte found within the Warrens of Snowcloak. Speak with the House Durendaire guard stationed at the tunnel entrance in the western highlands."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNA305_01606_SEQ_02","You enter the Akh Afah Amphitheatre, and soon cross paths with its heretical occupants. Though Alphinaud declares his intention to parley, the heretics are not inclined to trust his word, and the encounter quickly devolves into violence─an unwanted conflict from which you and your fellows emerge triumphant yet frustrated. With naught save the parting words of the retreating heretics on which to rely, you have little choice but to investigate the island known as the Dreaming Dragon. Speak with Estinien at the entrance to the Warrens, and plan the next step of your journey."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNA305_01606_SEQ_03","Before making for the Dreaming Dragon, Estinien suggests that you visit a group of dragonslayers known as the Convictors who have pitched camp in the region of Twinpools. Speak with the Convictors' leader, Jantellot, and learn what he knows of the heretics and their island lair."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNA305_01606_SEQ_04","Your meeting with the honored leader of the Convictors serves to convince you of two things: first, that Jantellot is ignorant of Iceheart's movements, and second, that he is only marginally better informed about those of his own men. After freely admitting that his fellow dragonslayers often fail to share information with him, he invites you to question them yourselves."

49,"TEXT_HEAVNA305_01606_ESTINIEN_000_001","If that is our destination, the journey will be long indeed. The amphitheatre lies on the other side of a treacherous tract of ice and snow that cannot swiftly be crossed."
50,"TEXT_HEAVNA305_01606_ALPHINAUD_000_002","Then we must place our faith in the Aethernet. As you may recall, our dear friend Moenbryda succeeded in recreating the Akh Afah beacon after it had been destroyed by Lady Iceheart. At the time, it was assumed that the resultant aetheryte would only be temporarily viable, but given that the heretics of Gorgagne Mills seem to have been in regular contact with their brethren at the amphitheatre, I'll wager it still functions. I suggest we make for the aetheryte within Snowcloak without delay."
51,"TEXT_HEAVNA305_01606_ALPHINAUD_000_003","Correct me if I am wrong, Estinien, but in the course of mapping the Snowcloak tunnel system, a passage was discovered leading out into the western highlands, was it not? Might it be possible for us to reach the aetheryte from this side of the wall?"
52,"TEXT_HEAVNA305_01606_ESTINIEN_000_004","It should. House Durendaire posted soldiers at the western highlands entrance after the tunnels were cleared, but they will not deny us entry."
