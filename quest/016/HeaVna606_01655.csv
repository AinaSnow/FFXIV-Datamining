1,"TEXT_HEAVNA606_01655_SEQ_01","The Dravanian hinterlands lie west of Tailfeather, and getting there requires that you travel through Gnath-held territory. Proceed with caution as you continue on your way to Sharlayan."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNA606_01655_SEQ_02","You have arrived in the Dravanian hinterlands. According to Y'shtola, Matoya dwells on the other side of the Thaliak River. Look for a place to cross to the opposite bank."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNA606_01655_SEQ_03","As you make your way through the ruins of Sharlayan, you encounter a band of goblins. The confrontation threatens to turn violent, but Alphinaud manages to defuse the situation by convincing the goblin leader, Slowfix, that your purpose is peaceful. In an abrupt change of tone, Slowfix offers to take you on a tour. Follow the goblin to the heart of the settlement and speak with him there."

In exchange for passage through the settlement, Slowfix asks that you help the denizens of Idyllshire with the myriad problems they face. For want of an alternate way to cross the Thaliak River, you decide to oblige the goblin."

72,"TEXT_HEAVNA606_01655_YSHTOLA_000_044","That is the short of it, aye. This place, Idyllshire─I came expecting a ghost town; suffice it to say I am surprised to find it so alive."
73,"TEXT_HEAVNA606_01655_MIDNIGHTDEW_000_045","Well, with all them precious artifacts lyin' about, 'twas only a matter of time afore treasure hunters like me moved in. But we weren't the first to arrive, neither. By then, Slowfix and his gobbie friends were already settled."
74,"TEXT_HEAVNA606_01655_SLOWFIX_000_046","At first, gobbies and hunters disliked each other. But understanding came, then friendship. Now gobbies and hunters have joined hands to build great new nation!"

78,"TEXT_HEAVNA606_01655_SLOWFIX_000_050","Pshkohhh, Slowfix has bright idea! Uplanders desire mutual understanding, yes? Best way to understanding is helping one another! Help citizens of Idyllshire, and uplanders can be citizens too! Citizens are free to cross river!"
79,"TEXT_HEAVNA606_01655_ALPHINAUD_000_051","Well, I am not aware of a quicker way to reach our destination. Let us assist Slowfix and his people."
80,"TEXT_HEAVNA606_01655_ALPHINAUD_000_052","From the goblins' perspective, such a well-appointed city is certainly an attractive proposition."
81,"TEXT_HEAVNA606_01655_YSHTOLA_000_052","I suppose it's only to be expected that others would come and occupy Sharlayan. Nonetheless, it feels akin to having strangers take over your home in your absence."
