In fact, Alka Zolka has already ventured forth to search for it among the ruins to the east. However, ancient guardians watching over Nymian assets may pose a threat to your marauder friend. Go now, and ensure his safety."

4,"TEXT_JOBSCH520_01672_SEQ_04","Surito takes the grand keystone with thanks. Though sealing his ailing friends away will not save them, it will give the scholar enough time to devise a cure.

※The next scholar quest will be available from Surito Carito upon reaching level 54."
