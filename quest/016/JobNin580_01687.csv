1,"TEXT_JOBNIN580_01687_SEQ_01","The Truehounds' auction has come and gone, and the Yatsurugi clan's blade has been sold to an Ishgardian collector who paid extra to have the dagger taken directly to his home. Princess Yuki plans to attack the transit directly in order to reclaim the dagger. To make matters easier, Oboro then suggests that you swap the pirates' pluto for lavender incense, that you might use their dependence against them and send them to sleep. He proposes that the four of you split up. He and Akagi will find where the Truehounds are keeping their stores in Limsa Lominsa, while you and the princess will purchase the incense from Kyokyoroon in Hawkers' Alley. Yuki, as usual, takes off in a huff, leaving you to follow behind her with the sack of gil to pay the merchant."
2,"TEXT_JOBNIN580_01687_SEQ_02","Shortly after purchasing a sack of lavender incense from Kyokyoroon, Yuki receives an unpleasant surprise─a pair of her vassals from the Far East has come in search of her. The princess deftly avoids their gaze, and vanishes with Akagi. A bemused Oboro instructs you to leave the princess to him, and asks that you make your way to Fisherman's Bottom. Once there, switch the pluto for the lavender incense."
3,"TEXT_JOBNIN580_01687_SEQ_03","The Truehounds will now fall into a deep slumber instead of receiving their usual stimulation. Now, wait near the docks and watch to make certain the guards do not detect your ruse."
4,"TEXT_JOBNIN580_01687_SEQ_04","You wait and listen as two Truehounds discuss their planned route─sail to Dravania, and go on foot from there to Ishgard. As the journey is long, and their crates heavy, they plan to stop once in the Smoldering Wastes and there take their “pluto.” With all parties in agreement that this would be the ideal place to strike, make your way to the Dravanian forelands and rendezvous with Princess Yuki and Oboro."
5,"TEXT_JOBNIN580_01687_SEQ_05","You arrive to find that Oboro's plan worked perfectly, with several Truehounds already snoring nearby and Yuki searching through their crates. However, as she has not yet found the Midare Kanemitsu dagger, and there are yet more Truehounds in the area, she bids you join Akagi and Oboro in their own patrols. Proceed to keep a lookout to the southwest, and dispatch any enemies that may come your way."
6,"TEXT_JOBNIN580_01687_SEQ_06","You have made short work of the Truehound patrol. Return to where Yuki was looking and see if Oboro and Akagi have anything to report from their own search."
7,"TEXT_JOBNIN580_01687_SEQ_07","You find Oboro none the worse for wear after his patrol. However, Akagi was not exaggerating his lack of martial prowess, and has sustained a serious injury. The princess joins you, triumphantly announcing that the last of her clan's treasures is again hers. However, both you and Oboro feel the hair on the back of your necks stand up. You turn to see Redway standing but a few yalms away. Instead of attacking, however, the man offers an ultimatum: the princess comes with him, or her vassals who recently came to Eorzea die. Unable to refuse, the princess walks away, leaving you with a single command: tend to Akagi. Beaten, Oboro orders you all to return to the dock storehouse."
8,"TEXT_JOBNIN580_01687_SEQ_08","Though you have lost this battle, Oboro is intent that you not lose the war; Princess Yuki did not forbid you from mounting a rescue. Await the day when Akagi is healed, as is your duty as a shinobi, and then save the princess from Redway and Rosalinde's clutches.

※The next ninja quest will be available from Oboro upon reaching level 60."
