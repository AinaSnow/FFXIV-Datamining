1,"TEXT_HEAVNA335_01636_SEQ_01","Estinien ponders the whereabouts of Nidhogg's missing eye, and muses over the great wyrm's sudden decision to hurl his entire army at the walls of Ishgard. Before he can come to a conclusion, however, the dragoon is interrupted by an urgent report from Ser Aymeric. It would seem that heretics have begun an uprising within the city itself. You return to Ishgard, and, with Ysayle's aid, seek to bring a peaceful end to the senseless destruction.

Upon entering the war-torn city, you are reunited with Lord Haurchefant. He quickly leads you to where a tense confrontation between the heretics and the Temple Knights threatens to explode into further violence. Lady Ysayle then tells her followers of the death of Nidhogg, and pronounces the Dragonsong War to be over. The heretics are thus persuaded to put up their arms, and retreat from the conflict at their mistress's command. Speak with Lord Haurchefant in the aftermath of the uprising."
