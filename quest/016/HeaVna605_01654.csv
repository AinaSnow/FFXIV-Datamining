1,"TEXT_HEAVNA605_01654_SEQ_01","According to Y'shtola, Matoya has been living as a hermit on the fringes of Sharlayan, in the Dravanian hinterlands. The journey will take you west through the Dravanian forelands. In order to prepare, Alphinaud suggests that you first return to Ishgard. Make your way back to the Holy See, and rejoin your comrades at the aetheryte plaza."
