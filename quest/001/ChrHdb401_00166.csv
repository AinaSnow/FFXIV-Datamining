1,"TEXT_CHRHDB401_00166_SEQ_01","Inspector's Log:
With my plan to out the thief at Miss Arabella's wedding proving a rousing success, we were <Emphasis>this</Emphasis> close to defending the treasure from the clutches of the many-faced fiend. But even the best-laid plans of inspectors extraordinaire are wont to go awry, and our phantom quarry successfully absconded with the so-called Maiden's Virtue. With no rest for the weary agent of enquiry, I have ventured to the Coliseum to begin my preliminary search of the environs. This time, I swear on the Manderville name, the phantom thief shall meet his match!
　　　　　　　　　　　　*　*　*
Ellie believes she has identified the thief's next target: a priceless treasure set to be awarded to the winner of the Mythril Cup, a tournament scheduled to be held at the Coliseum in the coming days. She informs you that her colleague Ganelon is in Ul'dah as you speak, researching for a feature on this very event. Travel to town and see what the reporter might tell you."
2,"TEXT_CHRHDB401_00166_SEQ_02","With some encouragement from Ellie, Ganelon shares his findings with you. It would seem that many of the scheduled combatants for the Mythril Cup have withdrawn due to injuries sustained under curious circumstances, leading to suspicions of foul play. Speak with the gatekeeper Yuyubaya to gain entrance to the Coliseum, that you might further question the relevant parties."
3,"TEXT_CHRHDB401_00166_SEQ_03","Upon arriving at the Coliseum and speaking with the organizer, one Dour Meadow, you soon reunite with a certain gentleman inspector and consulting detective, with the rivalry between the two as heated as ever. With a mind to keep the prizes out of the hands of the thief, you enter the tourney at Inspector Briardien's behest, submitting your application to the tentacled receptionist known by the name of Ultros. Fearing for your safety now that you have declared your intention to fight, Ellie suggests that you return to Ganelon and seek out more information on the shady attacks against potential combatants."
4,"TEXT_CHRHDB401_00166_SEQ_04","Ganelon shares with you his suspicions that the confident gladiatrix by the name of Avila might be in some way connected to the curious incidents. He encourages you to seek out one Raging Rat, a gladiator who fell to the selfsame Avila in the preliminary rounds, that you might gain the information you need to protect yourself."
5,"TEXT_CHRHDB401_00166_SEQ_05","Raging Rat suspects that Avila's renowned “Tempest Blade” is some sort of sorcery, while Ellie wonders if the Ala Mhigan shieldmaiden might not be being aided by one of her fellow refugees. Meanwhile, Hildibrand and Nashu have taken a harmless, if seemingly unfruitful, interest in a certain eight-legged individual. Humor him by traveling to the Coliseum and seeing where his investigation might have led."
6,"TEXT_CHRHDB401_00166_SEQ_06","Alongside Hildibrand, you pursue the shifty Ultros about and around the Coliseum. As expected, his behavior is most curious, if not particularly enlightening. Return to the Coliseum entrance and listen to Nashu's latest musings on the movements of her quarry."
7,"TEXT_CHRHDB401_00166_SEQ_07","Your pursuit of Ultros has proven to be every bit as fruitful as expected─which is to say, not very. Perhaps Inspector Hildibrand has managed to glean something from this utterly unremarkable turn of events. Inquire with him as to what may be on his mind."

131,"TEXT_CHRHDB401_00166_RAZINGRAT_000_203","...Never ye mind. Look, the records may say I lost, but I'll admit to nothin' o' the sort. I'll shout it at the top o' my lungs if no one else will. The girl doesn't fight fair."
132,"TEXT_CHRHDB401_00166_RAZINGRAT_000_204","Tempest Blade!? Some kind o' foul sorcery, if you ask me. Mark my words: that girl is up to no good. If she weren't so damned easy on the eyes, she'd be rottin' in gaol as we speak."
133,"TEXT_CHRHDB401_00166_RAZINGRAT_000_205","The girl's Ala Mhigan, or haven't ye heard? You know how it is with those refugees. Why fight with honor when ye've got nothin' to lose?"
134,"TEXT_CHRHDB401_00166_ELLIE_000_206","Yes, and why not disparage an entire people in a pathetic attempt to salvage your sorry pride? This one's a real piece of work, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Let's be on our way."
135,"TEXT_CHRHDB401_00166_RAZINGRAT_000_207","...I didn't mean no offense, miss. Just tellin' it like it is, as it were."
136,"TEXT_CHRHDB401_00166_NASHUMHAKARACCA_000_208","Perhaps it truly is some manner of sorcery, as the fellow says. Or perhaps she works with an accomplice?"
137,"TEXT_CHRHDB401_00166_ELLIE_000_209","She didn't strike me as the magic-wielding type. If I were a betting woman, I'd put my gil on the latter."
138,"TEXT_CHRHDB401_00166_HILDIBRAND_000_210","Ah, Miss Ellie! The thrill of the chase has struck a chord with you, as well! Yes, I can see it in the wrinkles beneath your eyes! We might very well make an inspectress of you yet!"
139,"TEXT_CHRHDB401_00166_ELLIE_000_211","I'll give you a good wrinkle, you insensitive boor! ...Ahem. If what the man says is true, it's likely that her fellow Ala Mhigans might sympathize with her plight. An accomplice would hardly be out of the question."
140,"TEXT_CHRHDB401_00166_HILDIBRAND_000_212","...Yes, I can see it now! Two unfortunate souls, shunned by those around them, united by destiny and a common desire for justice!"
141,"TEXT_CHRHDB401_00166_HILDIBRAND_000_213","Ample appendages whirling wildly, sending gusts of wind flying every which way! Avila and Ulty─a match made in the heavens! Were it any more obvious, I could have solved this case without leaving my home!"

146,"TEXT_CHRHDB401_00166_HILDIBRAND_000_251","Behold those exquisite legs! Those stylish tentacles! The unearthly undulations of his squirmy, squishy body! Yes, our friend Ulty is a most fascinating creature indeed."
147,"TEXT_CHRHDB401_00166_HILDIBRAND_000_252","Behold how he carefully eyes the gladiatrix before him. What manner of mischief is he plotting!?"

150,"TEXT_CHRHDB401_00166_HILDIBRAND_000_255","Our friend Ulty appears to be discouraged. Look at the way his shoulders sag! ...Or how they would sag, if he had shoulders."
