51,"TEXT_CLSTAN000_00105_RANDALL_000_4","Very well. I invite you to speak with Guildmaster Geva."
52,"TEXT_CLSTAN000_00105_RANDALL_000_5","She is a brilliant artisan, personally responsible for the creation of countless Fen–Yll products. You have doubtless heard her name before."
53,"TEXT_CLSTAN000_00105_RANDALL_000_6","The guildmaster's patterns are uniformly elegant, and with them even novice craftsmen can cut their materials with minimal waste."
54,"TEXT_CLSTAN000_00105_RANDALL_000_7","It is for her to decide if you are fit to join us."

58,"TEXT_CLSTAN000_00105_GEVA_000_12","Not just to the elementals, mind you, but also to the guild. Our craftsmanship is unrivaled, and each member is expected to live up to that reputation."

63,"TEXT_CLSTAN000_00105_A1_000_2","No"
64,"TEXT_CLSTAN000_00105_GEVA_000_15","A shame. You might have made a halfway decent leatherworker─or a serviceable saddle at worst."
65,"TEXT_CLSTAN000_00105_GEVA_000_16","Very well, you may learn our craft within these walls..."
66,"TEXT_CLSTAN000_00105_GEVA_000_17","...though you seem ill equipped to do even that."
67,"TEXT_CLSTAN000_00105_GEVA_000_18","I will give you a head knife to help you on your way, but the rest is up to you."
68,"TEXT_CLSTAN000_00105_GEVA_000_19","Do not presume that your association with us means your work will bear the Fen–Yll name. Until you prove yourself worthy, you will not be permitted to so much as <Emphasis>touch</Emphasis> a Fen–Yll product, much less craft one."
69,"TEXT_CLSTAN000_00105_GEVA_000_20","Now then, if we're to continue with your initiation, you'll need to put that knife in your hand first. Talk to me when you're ready to begin."
