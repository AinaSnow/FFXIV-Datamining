49,"TEXT_CLSBSM001_00185_RANDWULF_000_2","In these here hallowed halls, Limsa's finest pound metal into all manner o' tools and weapons. And when I say Limsa's, I mean the whole bloody realm's. Make no mistake─ye need more than a big arm to join our ranks."
50,"TEXT_CLSBSM001_00185_RANDWULF_000_3","But if ye've got iron in yer veins and the Builder's blessin', speak up."
51,"TEXT_CLSBSM001_00185_Q1_000_1","Join the Blacksmiths' Guild?"
52,"TEXT_CLSBSM001_00185_A1_000_1","Yes"
53,"TEXT_CLSBSM001_00185_A1_000_2","No"

55,"TEXT_CLSBSM001_00185_RANDWULF_000_12","Well then, bugger off. I've no time to waste on idle adventurers who've got naught better to do than run around pesterin' honest guild receptionists. Don't bother me again unless yer resolved to join."
56,"TEXT_CLSBSM001_00185_RANDWULF_000_21","Hmmm...ye've got fire in yer belly, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>, I'll give ye that. Might even make a half-decent smitty one day."
57,"TEXT_CLSBSM001_00185_RANDWULF_000_22","But that day's a way off yet. I reckon ye should see where yer current path leads before choosin' a new one."

60,"TEXT_CLSBSM001_00185_RANDWULF_000_32","But do ye truly know what yer gettin' yerself into here, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>?"
61,"TEXT_CLSBSM001_00185_RANDWULF_000_33","Ours is a trade born o' blood and brine. Fer as long as pirates have sailed the Rhotano, smitties have forged their weapons and fitted out their ships from keel to cannon."
62,"TEXT_CLSBSM001_00185_RANDWULF_000_34","'Course, “till sea swallows all” ain't just an idle sayin'─brine'll eat through even the stoutest iron given time, and our forebears long struggled to forge more rust-resistant alloys."
63,"TEXT_CLSBSM001_00185_RANDWULF_000_35","Lucky fer us, the smitties of eld were a determined bunch, and clever too. So when they learned that the kobolds knew somethin' of advanced metallurgy, the smitties set out to make it their own."
64,"TEXT_CLSBSM001_00185_RANDWULF_000_36","Thanks to the kobolds' wisdom─which they generously gifted us with only the merest <Emphasis>hint</Emphasis> o' pirately promptin'─Lominsan smithin' came on leaps and bounds."
65,"TEXT_CLSBSM001_00185_RANDWULF_000_37","'Twasn't long before the Gridanians and Ul'dahns started eyein' our knowledge like we did the kobolds', though. And so, some hundred and fifty-odd years ago, two particularly forward-thinkin' men named Theor Naldiq and Bryce Vymelli had the bright idea of establishin' a respectable business."
66,"TEXT_CLSBSM001_00185_RANDWULF_000_38","Bein' fair-minded fellows, they'd sell their wares to anyone who had the coin─pirates and foreigners included. And when folks weren't inclined to pay, they made sure to remind 'em that we hadn't completely forsaken our pirate ways."
67,"TEXT_CLSBSM001_00185_RANDWULF_000_39","Times have changed, though, and we're a wee bit more willin' to share our wisdom these days. The company's been runnin' the Blacksmiths' and Armorers' Guilds fer years now, welcomin' any soul with the necessary talent and will to work."
68,"TEXT_CLSBSM001_00185_RANDWULF_000_40","As to whether ye've got enough of either...well, that's fer the forgemaster to decide. Speak to me when yer ready to present yerself to him."
