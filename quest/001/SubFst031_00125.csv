49,"TEXT_SUBFST031_00125_PAULINE_000_2","In our efforts to commune with the elementals, we conjurers often find ourselves in the area. Of late, however, our meditations have all too frequently been interrupted by unprovoked anole attacks. Truly, the beasts grow more aggressive by the day."

If you could slay half a dozen or so of the beasts, that should lessen their need to hunt and also serve as a warning to the anoles to remain within their territory."

If we are to truly break this spiraling growth, then we must also target their future offspring.
