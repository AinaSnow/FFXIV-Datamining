1,"TEXT_CLSWDK006_00169_SEQ_01","Word of your craftsmanship has spread, and a client has requested you by name. Prepare a walnut cane of the highest quality and present it to Beatin for inspection."
2,"TEXT_CLSWDK006_00169_SEQ_02","Beatin decrees that the cane will satisfy your client. Look for him at the Adders' Nest and deliver the cane."
3,"TEXT_CLSWDK006_00169_SEQ_03","The client, Gairhard, is having difficulty earning the trust of a conjurer newly assigned to his unit. In an effort to show her that some outsiders mean no harm, and wish only to help, he commissioned you to make the cane. He asks you to deliver it to Ponette at Stillglade Fane on his behalf."
4,"TEXT_CLSWDK006_00169_SEQ_04","Ponette is deeply moved by the walnut cane. She apologizes for judging outsiders so harshly and acknowledges the contribution made by individuals like Captain Gairhard and yourself to Gridania's cause. Return to the Adders' Nest and inform the captain of the conjurer's change of heart."
5,"TEXT_CLSWDK006_00169_SEQ_05","Captain Gairhard congratulates you on a job well done, noting that Beatin was right to favor you. Return to the timbermaster and inform him that the commission is complete."
6,"TEXT_CLSWDK006_00169_SEQ_06","The timbermaster's pleasure at the news of your success is matched only by his surprise at the revelation that your client was in fact an old friend of his, back from a long campaign abroad. Though puzzled by Gairhard's failure to inform him of his return, Beatin is nonetheless relieved to hear that he is in good health.

※The next carpenter quest will be available from Beatin upon reaching level 35."

57,"TEXT_CLSWDK006_00169_BEATINE_000_14","Indeed, your skillful application of growth formula has imbued this cane with new life, giving it the appearance of unworked wood."
58,"TEXT_CLSWDK006_00169_BEATINE_000_15","Wands and canes are perhaps the purest expression of the carpenter's creed, in that the finished product is a celebration of the wood's past life."

75,"TEXT_CLSWDK006_00169_PONETTE_000_34","And one so finely wrought that I scarce believe it man-made."
76,"TEXT_CLSWDK006_00169_PONETTE_000_35","To conjurers, our canes are the physical representation of our connection with the living world. They provide a focus for us to channel the forces of nature and weave spells."
77,"TEXT_CLSWDK006_00169_PONETTE_000_36","To possess a cane made of walnut is a dream most conjurers share. And I am no different. I see the beauty of this cane, and the heart of the <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If> who made it."

83,"TEXT_CLSWDK006_00169_PONETTE_000_42","My thanks again, adventurer. Should you meet with the captain before I do, please convey my gratitude."

87,"TEXT_CLSWDK006_00169_GAIRHARD_000_52","So it goes. Anyway, duty calls. Thank you again, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Please give my regards to the timbermaster."

89,"TEXT_CLSWDK006_00169_BEATINE_000_61","Interesting. So the client was not a conjurer himself..."
90,"TEXT_CLSWDK006_00169_BEATINE_000_62","In any case, I am glad to hear that the intended recipient was satisfied."
91,"TEXT_CLSWDK006_00169_BEATINE_000_63","I must know, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>: who was this client? I only received their messenger, and I cannot fathom why they would not come in person."
92,"TEXT_CLSWDK006_00169_BEATINE_000_64","...Gairhard!? You are certain?"
93,"TEXT_CLSWDK006_00169_BEATINE_000_65","I thought him far from Gridania, on campaign. When did he return? And why would he not greet me in person?"
94,"TEXT_CLSWDK006_00169_BEATINE_000_66","We have known each other for so many years... Well, I can only assume that his duties leave no time for such niceties. I am glad to hear he is home and well."
95,"TEXT_CLSWDK006_00169_BEATINE_000_67","Thank you for attending to his request, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I look forward to our next meeting."
