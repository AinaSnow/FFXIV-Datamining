1,"TEXT_SUBCTS818_00164_SEQ_01","Slafborn informs you an acquaintance of Cid awaits your arrival within the workshop. He warns you, however, that her disposition is anything but cordial. Speak with Slafborn once more to enter the workshop, then see what business this visitor has brought."
2,"TEXT_SUBCTS818_00164_SEQ_02","You enter the workshop to find Jessie, deputy president of Garlond Ironworks, waiting for you, though she makes it clear that her current title was thrust upon her in Cid's absence. She explains that a recent drop in productivity has left them scrambling to make ends meet, and asks to see your magitek armor in the hopes of drawing inspiration for a new product.

While at first taken aback by the sleek design of your suit, she is inevitably disappointed by the damaged weaponry. Unable to bear seeing good steel go to waste, she insists you gather parts so that she may begin repairs immediately. Make your way to Castrum Centri and retrieve a magitek converter #49, magitek oscillator #50, and magitek cannon barrel #51 from the Empire's storage crates."
3,"TEXT_SUBCTS818_00164_SEQ_03","You have collected the parts needed to restore your magitek armor. Hurry back to Cid's workshop and deliver them to Jessie."
4,"TEXT_SUBCTS818_00164_SEQ_04","Jessie is pleased to see you have located the required parts, and restores the magitek armor to the best of her abilities. Though the weapons are now functional, she warns you that they are not quite suitable for combat."

48,"TEXT_SUBCTS818_00164_SLAFBORN_000_001","Greetings, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. You've come at just the right time. A visitor is waiting for you in the workshop. A friend of Cid, it seems."
49,"TEXT_SUBCTS818_00164_SLAFBORN_000_002","Realizing your preoccupation with other matters of import, I suggested she wait at the Seventh Heaven until your arrival, but she refuses to leave. I fear you have a very brash client on your hands, friend."
50,"TEXT_SUBCTS818_00164_Q1_000_000","Proceed to Cid's workshop?"
51,"TEXT_SUBCTS818_00164_A2_000_001","Yes"

54,"TEXT_SUBCTS818_00164_SLAFBORN_000_003","I must confess, it's been quite some time since I've encountered someone quite so boorish. I would suggest you see to her business as quickly as possible, lest her presence hinder business in the workshop."
55,"TEXT_SUBCTS818_00164_JESSIE_000_010","So you're <If(PlayerParameter(4))>Miss<Else/>Mister</If> <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,2)/>, eh? Took you long enough. The name's Jessie, deputy president of Garlond Ironworks."
56,"TEXT_SUBCTS818_00164_JESSIE_000_011","Don't look too impressed, now. In truth, I'm nothing more than an engineer, but thanks to <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> filling Master Garlond's head with them damfool ideas of <Emphasis>heroism</Emphasis> and <Emphasis>saving the realm</Emphasis>, there's no one else around to fill his golden breeches."
57,"TEXT_SUBCTS818_00164_JESSIE_000_012","We've been busting our collective arses on these orders from Highwind Skyways, and are still only scraping by. The real problem is, with Master Garlond gone, productivity's dropped like the knickers on a Stonesthrow strumpet. The company'll be in deep if something ain't done."
58,"TEXT_SUBCTS818_00164_JESSIE_000_013","And that's why I'm here. Sure, our machinists have made their fair share of chronometers and plasma lamps, but we need something <Emphasis>grand</Emphasis>─something that'll have clients on their knees literally begging us to take all their sparkling gil."
59,"TEXT_SUBCTS818_00164_JESSIE_000_014","I want you to show me the magitek armor you <Emphasis>borrowed</Emphasis> from our friends the Garleans. Yes, yes, I know all about your little foray into the Praetorium. You can thank Biggs and Wedge for that."
60,"TEXT_SUBCTS818_00164_JESSIE_000_015","I reckon there's a lot we can learn from that reaper, and after all you've done to distract Master Garlond, I'd say you owe us that much and more."
61,"TEXT_SUBCTS818_00164_JESSIE_000_016","This is amazing! Do you even know what you have here? Listen to that ceruleum engine. I've never heard anything so sweet!"
62,"TEXT_SUBCTS818_00164_JESSIE_000_017","And the servomechanism should be... Wait! A mammet core!? Why didn't I think of that!? They're so easy to come by, mass production would be as easy as stealing candy from a baby...or cores from a mammet."
63,"TEXT_SUBCTS818_00164_JESSIE_000_018","But what in the seven bloody hells have you done to the cannon's poor convergence modulator!? Burnt it out firing victory rounds after slaying some family of rabid squirrels, no doubt. It's a wonder the whole suit isn't a steaming pile of molten slag. Such a waste..."
64,"TEXT_SUBCTS818_00164_JESSIE_000_019","What in the Builder's name are you looking at? You need something to fix your prying eyes on, try the wall."
65,"TEXT_SUBCTS818_00164_JESSIE_000_020","Anyroad, I can't bear to see such a fine piece of work in such a sorry state. I'll patch her up as best I can, but you'll need to gather the parts needed for the job. Think of it as one of them adventures you seem so keen on."
66,"TEXT_SUBCTS818_00164_JESSIE_000_021","A make #49 magitek converter and a make #50 magitek oscillator should do the trick. Oh, and a magitek cannon barrel, make...er...#51. I can't guarantee she'll be good as new, but at the very least she'll be in better shape than she's in now...which still ain't saying much."
67,"TEXT_SUBCTS818_00164_JESSIE_000_022","Eyes on me, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I ain't done with you yet. That is, unless you know whereabouts one might stumble across a spare converter, oscillator, and cannon barrel. No? Didn't think so. So here's a hint─it rhymes with Castrum Centri.
You see, Garlean-made technology is what we're after, and I can't think of a better place to find some. Off with you now!"
68,"TEXT_SUBCTS818_00164_JESSIE_000_023","You lonely, or just poor with numbers? I'm assuming the latter, so listen up. We need a magitek converter #49, a magitek oscillator #50, and a magitek cannon barrel #51. You might want to write that down, unless it is you're poor with letters, to boot."
69,"TEXT_SUBCTS818_00164_JESSIE_000_024","Now off to Castrum Centri with you. And no stopping to sniff the sunflowers. It breaks my heart every second I have to think about that armor in such sorry shape."
70,"TEXT_SUBCTS818_00164_SLAFBORN_000_025","Welcome back. Still attending to business in the workshop?"
71,"TEXT_SUBCTS818_00164_JESSIE_100_030","Let me guess. You've lost...no, broken...no, <Emphasis>traded for magical beans</Emphasis> the parts we need."
72,"TEXT_SUBCTS818_00164_JESSIE_000_030","Well, color me mildly impressed. I was half expecting the worst, and got...well, less than the worst."
73,"TEXT_SUBCTS818_00164_JESSIE_000_031","Don't get all giddy on me, now. You're still not off the hook for stealing away Master Garlond. But I'll admit, I'm beginning to see why he might feel the need to latch himself onto an adventurer like he might a stray pup. Alright, let's see if I can't salvage this mess of a masterpiece."
74,"TEXT_SUBCTS818_00164_JESSIE_000_032","Phew, I think that's it. Both magitek and photon cannons <Emphasis>should</Emphasis> be functional."
75,"TEXT_SUBCTS818_00164_JESSIE_000_033","That said, I'm no Garlean. There's no third eye hidden up under these lovely locks, and there's a great deal I don't know about their machina. I can't guarantee the cannons won't misfire, but then again, misfire is better than no fire, eh? Even so, I wouldn't recommend using the weaponry in actual battle."
76,"TEXT_SUBCTS818_00164_JESSIE_000_034","Speaking of fire, it's high time I got back to the Ironworks. Patching up those cannons has given me a few ideas. You take good care of that armor, or you'll have me to answer to, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."
77,"TEXT_SUBCTS818_00164_SYSTEM_000_040","Your magitek armor's magitek and photon cannons are now operational. They can be accessed via the Pet Hotbar when riding your mount. However, please note that these weapons do not employ lethal force, and will have no effect in combat."
