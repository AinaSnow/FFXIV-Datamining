1,"TEXT_CLSWDK005_00168_SEQ_01","Though he did not choose to confide in you, something is clearly troubling Beatin. For now, he has asked you to attend to the younglings in the Acorn Orchard."
2,"TEXT_CLSWDK005_00168_SEQ_02","Nicoliaux is certain that Beatin is experiencing a sudden dearth of creativity. Until the timbermaster finds a new source of inspiration, Nicoliaux fears he will remain morose and uninteresting. Craft and bring Beatin a length of high-quality walnut lumber to deliver him from his depression."
3,"TEXT_CLSWDK005_00168_SEQ_03","Just as Nicoliaux intended, Beatin is struck by the seemingly infinite uses to which he might put your high-quality walnut lumber. Recalling an old friend who once aided him in similar fashion, he thanks you for your help, before reminding you that he expects nothing less than the best from one with your undoubted talent.

※The next carpenter quest will be available from Beatin upon reaching level 30."
