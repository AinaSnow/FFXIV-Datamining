1,"TEXT_SUBCTS815_00152_SEQ_01","You overhear Syntgoht thinking aloud, worried over a shipment of goods that has yet to arrive. It's not long before he is aware of your presence, and, after sensing the air of gallantry about you, presumes you to be an adventurer who can assist him in his time of need. Looking to receive his wares as soon as possible, Syntgoht asks that you speak with Nesting Heron at the Bonfire in central Thanalan."
2,"TEXT_SUBCTS815_00152_SEQ_02","Arriving at the Bonfire, you speak with Nesting Heron and are reassured to find that the shipping preparations for Syntgoht's goods are complete. The reason for the delay, she explains, is her preoccupation with a crafting phenomenon known as desynthesis. After explaining the basics of this process and going over the discovery of a new crafting catalyst called demimateria, she encourages you to try desynthesis for yourself, that you might discover the latent potential of previously crafted wares."

50,"TEXT_SUBCTS815_00152_SYNTGOHT_000_002","I know what you're thinking, but considering the client, this request is certain to benefit you as well."
51,"TEXT_SUBCTS815_00152_SYNTGOHT_000_003","If you're up for the task, I would have you speak with Nesting Heron at the Bonfire in central Thanalan. For the shipment to be so late, I can only imagine some new innovation of that Mutamix fellow has her preoccupied."
52,"TEXT_SUBCTS815_00152_SYNTGOHT_000_004","Please make haste to the Bonfire. I need those goods delivered as soon as possible. With any luck, Mutamix will have discovered something interesting to share with you, as well."
53,"TEXT_SUBCTS815_00152_NESTINGHERON_000_010","What's this about a shipment? Oh, yes, of course. The package is prepared and ready to be shipped. I meant to handle it sooner, but I've become engrossed in the study of desynthesis."
54,"TEXT_SUBCTS815_00152_NESTINGHERON_000_011","I'll be sure to send word of your visit along with his wares."
55,"TEXT_SUBCTS815_00152_NESTINGHERON_000_012","Hm? You have not heard of desynthesis? I suppose you would have to visit the Bonfire quite often to keep pace with Mutamix's myriad findings. Allow me to explain."
56,"TEXT_SUBCTS815_00152_NESTINGHERON_000_013","Desynthesis is a new technique developed by Mutamix to break down weapons and armor into their constituent parts."
57,"TEXT_SUBCTS815_00152_NESTINGHERON_000_014","In short, it allows the <Emphasis>retrieval</Emphasis> of those materials originally used to craft an item. On occasion, the process will also yield a peculiar crystallized mass."
58,"TEXT_SUBCTS815_00152_NESTINGHERON_000_015","There is still much research to be done, but we believe the mass is formed from residual spiritbond energies infused into equipment by the hands that crafted them. Because the process is similar to the creation of materia, we've come to call these crystals “demimateria.”"
59,"TEXT_SUBCTS815_00152_NESTINGHERON_000_016","Just imagine the applications! Fortifying weapons, creating new armor─the possibilities are limitless."
60,"TEXT_SUBCTS815_00152_NESTINGHERON_000_017","It may also be worth mentioning that, while some of the demimateria by-products seemed unfit for reuse, their radiance was not unlike the rubies and sapphires one might find for sale in Ul'dah. I imagine they would fetch a fair price if you were to show them to the right buyer."
61,"TEXT_SUBCTS815_00152_NESTINGHERON_000_018","But if you are truly interested in learning more of desynthesis, I can think of no better way than trying it yourself! Perhaps the next time we meet, you can tell me of your own findings."
