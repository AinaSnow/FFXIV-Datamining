1,"TEXT_CLSROG301_00155_SEQ_01","Jacke has decided that a net of rogues cast over the city is the only way to catch the Reformists before they can go through with their murderous plan. Take up your position at the Aftcastle, and stay vigilant for any signs of Aisibhir and his crew."
2,"TEXT_CLSROG301_00155_SEQ_02","Slipping past the vigilant gazes of rogues and Yellowjackets alike, the Reformists manage to reach the Mizzenmast and prime the Black Sarcophagus to explode. With scant moments left until the mine is set to detonate, however, you manage to disable the device and save the city from untold destruction. Aisibhir and his crew are defeated, and the prototype weapon once again safe in the hands of the Yellowjackets.

As for Milala's challenge, Jacke's keen ears and nimble fingers have allowed the impudent guildmaster to liberate the Silver Sorrows from the ailing and unsuspecting captain. Thus do the rogues end the contest with two of the three treasures, ensuring victory for the guild. Return to the Dutiful Sisters and speak with Jacke."

Should you choose to leave the shadows of the underworld, however, he suggests that you devote yourself to a code of your own, and employ your deadly new skills to uphold it. Though your eyes may readjust to the light of day, the lessons learned at the Dutiful Sisters will never leave you."
