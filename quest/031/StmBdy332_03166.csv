0,"TEXT_STMBDY332_03166_SEQ_00","The fate of the Ruby Sea hangs in the balance, and Seiryu is eager to play his part."
1,"TEXT_STMBDY332_03166_SEQ_01","Restored to his former self and wholly aware of the dire circumstances, Seiryu departs with all due haste for Reisen Temple. With luck, you and he will not be too late to prevent the mad auspice Koryu from breaking free..."
2,"TEXT_STMBDY332_03166_SEQ_02","You, Tataru, and Soroban stand by as the Four Lords bring their combined power to bear against Koryu, and for a moment, all proceeds according to plan. Alas, relief soon gives way to despair as the restored wards shatter, and the mad auspice emerges from the sacred crystal, the picture of rage personified. In a flash, he dispatches Genbu, and with him the last vestiges of hope. Your fates all but sealed, you join with the surviving auspices in a valiant yet futile last stand...only to find yourselves in the company of the long-dead Tenzen. Yet even bolstered by the spirit's considerable strength, you are unable to beat back Koryu, until Soroban, in a noble act of sacrifice, summons the soul of the departed Genbu into his body that the resurrected auspice might turn the tide, and together with you and his comrades imprison Koryu for millennia to come."
3,"TEXT_STMBDY332_03166_SEQ_03","The Ruby Sea and her people shall live to see another day, but not without cost, for Soroban is no more...or is he? It would seem that the Kojin's soul is possessed of immense spiritual strength, owing to his recent trials and tribulations. Accordingly, when he summoned Genbu's soul into his body, his own managed to endure; as a result, however, the auspice's resurrection is fleeting, and in time he will pass from this world as before. With his remaining time, he intends to train Soroban to succeed him as the next Genbu and take his place alongside his comrades as one of the Four Lords. Though he is by no means confident in his ability to rise to the occasion, the Kojin understands and appreciates the need for guardians to watch over the Ruby Sea, and is willing to do his best to live up to their expectations."
4,"TEXT_STMBDY332_03166_SEQ_04","You go to each of Genbu's comrades in turn, who thank you for your assistance and muse on the unknown future. Byakko sees many battles in your future, and wishes you good fortune in the wars to come; Suzaku bids you come and visit again, for you will always hold a special place in her heart; Seiryu demands that you live long and grow strong, for he looks forward to a rematch. Parting words had, you rejoin a Tataru eager to receive the fabulous reward which first drew her to Hells' Lid."
5,"TEXT_STMBDY332_03166_SEQ_05","The reward is indeed fabulous and more than makes up for the reckless purchase by a certain well-meaning youth that led you to pursue means by which you might replenish the coffers of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn in the first place. The collective is even willing to deliver the payment to the Ruby Bazaar in your stead, leaving you and Tataru to return to Tamamizu and inform Bunchin of Soroban's new role as a member of the Four Lords."
6,"TEXT_STMBDY332_03166_SEQ_06","Bunchin is understandably surprised and saddened to hear that Soroban will not be returning to the village for quite some time, if not ever. Nevertheless, it fills him with pride to think that a Kojin of the Blue has been granted such a tremendous honor. Still, he cannot help but worry that Soroban might grow lonely in the days ahead, and so he asks that you make an effort to go and see him from time to time. And why would you not? For there are few places in the world one may enjoy the company of adorable and surly talking beasts!"

And maybe the two of us can have ourselves another match for old times' sake? You can even bring your friends like before─I don't mind!"
148,"TEXT_STMBDY332_03166_KUDAGITSUNE_000_243","I understand. Our lives lead us where they may, and yours leads you elsewhere. So it was with Tamamo Gozen. I shall remember you fondly."
149,"TEXT_STMBDY332_03166_INUGAMI_000_244","Before you came, I bore man a terrible grudge. Less so, now, for I am comforted to know that there are good and honorable ones such as you. Live well, and teach others to do the same, that I might never need resume my hunt."
150,"TEXT_STMBDY332_03166_KOMAINU_000_245","We may go to greater lengths to conceal the temple's existence from outsiders in the future. However, you will always be welcome to come and go as you like."
151,"TEXT_STMBDY332_03166_SOROBAN_000_250","(-Genbu-)Come and claim your reward, honored friends!"
152,"TEXT_STMBDY332_03166_TATARU_000_251","It's...it's beautiful! It's so beautiful! More than enough to make up for a thousand thousand of Alphinaud's reckless purchases!"
153,"TEXT_STMBDY332_03166_SOROBAN_000_252","(-Genbu-)A fitting reward for saviors of the Ruby Sea."
154,"TEXT_STMBDY332_03166_TATARU_000_253","To be honest, I was half expecting another terrible joke, but you really followed through. Hmm... Getting this home is going to be no easy task..."
155,"TEXT_STMBDY332_03166_SOROBAN_000_254","(-Genbu-)If transportation is a concern, we would be happy to deliver it to a destination of your choosing."
156,"TEXT_STMBDY332_03166_TATARU_000_255","Really? Just like that? Um, in that case...the Ruby Bazaar in Kugane? If it's no trouble, that is..."
157,"TEXT_STMBDY332_03166_SOROBAN_000_256","(-Genbu-)None whatsoever. Every member of the collective should be glad to lend a hand."
158,"TEXT_STMBDY332_03166_SOROBAN_000_257","(-Genbu-)...And with that, I take my leave."
159,"TEXT_STMBDY332_03166_TATARU_000_258","So...Soroban? Will you really stay here and not return to Tamamizu?"
160,"TEXT_STMBDY332_03166_SOROBAN_000_259","Well...I did agree to become the next Genbu..."
161,"TEXT_STMBDY332_03166_SOROBAN_000_260","(-Genbu-)For the duration of his training, I would have him remain here. It will be a long, hard road, believe you me, and I intend to spend my remaining years guiding him. All five hundred or so."
162,"TEXT_STMBDY332_03166_SOROBAN_000_261","And there you have it. I hope I can impose upon you to deliver Bunchin the news..."
163,"TEXT_STMBDY332_03166_SOROBAN_000_262","Wait─five hundred years? As in, you will be here for another five centuries!? I thought you said the enchantment would fade “ere long”!"
164,"TEXT_STMBDY332_03166_SOROBAN_000_263","(-Genbu-)Th-These things are relative! And what's with that tone of yours, anyway? You should be honored to be the beneficiary of my sage tutelage. Foolish turtle!"

168,"TEXT_STMBDY332_03166_SOROBAN_000_267","(-Genbu-)Ahem. Thank you for everything, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Tataru. Safe travels."
169,"TEXT_STMBDY332_03166_BUNCHIN_000_300","Hmm... I sense you have reasons other than the usual for this particular visit. Might it have something to do with Soroban?"
170,"TEXT_STMBDY332_03166_BUNCHIN_000_301","I beg your pardon? Soroban is to become the next Genbu?"
171,"TEXT_STMBDY332_03166_BUNCHIN_000_302","I will not feign understanding. However this extraordinary state of affairs came about is utterly beyond my ken. As unbelievable as I yet find it, though, I have no doubt that you speak true."
172,"TEXT_STMBDY332_03166_TATARU_000_303","Soroban's had an incredible string of bad luck. Succumbing to the aramitama, becoming a giant tortoise, and now this."
173,"TEXT_STMBDY332_03166_TATARU_000_304","On the other hand, he could have refused, and instead agreed to take on this responsibility. So we may as well support him, don't you think?"
174,"TEXT_STMBDY332_03166_BUNCHIN_000_305","Indeed. Though it pains me to imagine Tamamizu without our Soroban, it fills me with pride to know that a Kojin of the Blue has been granted this great honor."
175,"TEXT_STMBDY332_03166_BUNCHIN_000_306","We shall pray for him, that he may rise to the occasion and serve as a benevolent guardian to all who call the Ruby Sea home."

177,"TEXT_STMBDY332_03166_TATARU_000_308","Oh no, the pleasure was all ours─and the profit!"
178,"TEXT_STMBDY332_03166_BUNCHIN_000_309","I am not sure I take your meaning, but I appreciate the sentiment. But if I might ask a final favor: would you be so kind as to look in on him from time to time? Just to see that he is getting on all right?"
179,"TEXT_STMBDY332_03166_TATARU_000_310","Of course!"
180,"TEXT_STMBDY332_03166_TATARU_000_311","It's not every day you make friends with a secret collective of talking animals, after all! Even if Soroban hadn't decided to remain at Reisen Temple, I wouldn't have wanted to stay away."
181,"TEXT_STMBDY332_03166_TATARU_000_312","You can be sure I'll head there from time to time. You're welcome to join me when I do, of course!"
