0,"TEXT_FESXMS402_03174_SEQ_00","Baenfaeld is keen to put his booming voice to good use.
※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESXMS402_03174_SEQ_01","While Baenfaeld is somewhat apprehensive about singing before an audience, his determination to contribute to the success of the Starlight Celebration is without question. He explains that the crowd is being divided into two groups, with a Starlight celebrant assigned to each. For better or worse, the festival staff have wildly differing approaches in their pre-perfomance banter, with one guide exaggerating the musical ability of the choir to ridiculous extremes. As a result, that particular group's expectations are considerably higher than the other, and a more complex and challenging song is required to satisfy them. Thankfully, you are free to choose which collective of spectators you will perform for first.

※Please note that you will not be able to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESXMS402_03174_SEQ_02","Through a combination of your burgeoning conductorial skill and the choir's impressive harmonies, the crowd is convinced that you are the genuine article, rather than a hastily assembled gaggle of complete beginners with next to no knowledge of traditional Ishgardian choral music. Baenfaeld in particular surprised all with an unexpected talent for applying his bellowing voice to more musical ends. Out of breath but elated, he seems keen for you to join him for some post-concert chitchat."
3,"TEXT_FESXMS402_03174_SEQ_03","Baenfaeld, as you can well imagine, is delighted with the choir's performance. Having successfully made it through an entire concert without any major catastrophes, he is confident that he and the other vocalists should be able to repeat their musical feats even without the aid of a conductor. Should you find an opening in your busy schedule, the choir would no doubt leap at the opportunity to work alongside their much-vaunted maestro."
