1,"TEXT_BANNAM005_03101_SEQ_01","Gyoshin summons you to a meeting to discuss a matter of dire import. Though he never manages to explain, one can safely assume that, were he given the opportunity, he would say that the Namazu must improve their festival, lest they be annihilated in seven years. Seven years! With that in mind, Seigetsu the Enlightened suggests that they incorporate a bizarre ritual so the festival will be more like the “unforgettable spectacles” once held by the Namazu of yore. Having concluded that Master Matoya would be the best source of information on such rituals, you stow Gyoshin in your bag once again and prepare to make for the Dravanian hinterlands.

In the meantime, Gyoshin manages to drink too much tea for his own good, and will have to be carried back to Dhoro Iloh in your luggage."

Seigetsu the Enlightened sends the tome flying, and while Gyoshin manages to prevent it falling into the bonfire, he himself is not so lucky. The unique experience of being set ablaze inspires him to hold the Wicker Man ritual, and, seeing the fire in his eyes, none have the courage to stop him."
