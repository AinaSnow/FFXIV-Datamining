※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESBKC001_03158_SEQ_01","Kipih Jakkya, reporter for <Emphasis>The Raven</Emphasis>, tells you about a rumor that has been making its rounds of late. Apparently, an unusual black vehicle has been sighted in Thanalan along with peculiar mechanical soldiers, and there is growing concern that they may be some unknown type of Garlean weaponry. Kipih petitions your assistance to pen her story, and in case you should be amenable, she directs you to the vicinity of Black Brush, where the black vehicle was most recently sighted.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESBKC001_03158_SEQ_02","At Black Brush, you come upon the black vehicle and its owner, a young man by the name of Noctis, who appears to be very far from home. His vehicle, the Regalia, has broken down, and he is relieved to learn that you know people who might be able to repair it. Soon after, you are joined by a crew from Garlond Ironworks and Cid himself, who promises to do his best with the Regalia. It then transpires that not only is Noctis acquainted with the mechanical soldiers, which he calls magitek troopers, but that both he and his automated adversaries hail from a world entirely different from your own. At Cid's suggestion, Noctis goes off to search for the magitek troopers in hopes of finding a way to return home. Follow Noctis and help him to defeat the magitek troopers by participating in the FATE “Like Clockwork” at the Clutch in central Thanalan."
3,"TEXT_FESBKC001_03158_SEQ_03","You and Noctis encounter a squad of magitek troopers and promptly vanquish them, along with a towering warmachina that had somehow managed to escape notice till now. The task thus concluded, Noctis turns his steps towards Black Brush, and you follow on his heels."
4,"TEXT_FESBKC001_03158_SEQ_04","On the road, Noctis laments that while the enemies indeed came from his world, they offered no clues as to how he might make his way back. For now, the two of you decide to return to the Regalia before seeking further help."
5,"TEXT_FESBKC001_03158_SEQ_05","After hearing about your battle with the magitek troopers, Cid expresses his interest in examining their technology, and bids you salvage their parts from future encounters. These parts may be delivered to one of the Ironworks hands posted at Black Brush and in each of the three city-states. Just as Cid is explaining that he had moved the Regalia to keep it away from prying eyes, Kipih Jakkya arrives on the scene and begins bombarding Noctis with questions. In exchange for receiving help to find his way home, Noctis agrees to an exclusive interview, and he sets out for Ul'dah with Kipih."
6,"TEXT_FESBKC001_03158_SEQ_06","Arriving in Ul'dah at the interview's conclusion, you learn that Noctis had been traveling with his comrades on his way to meet his beloved fiancée. Satisfied with her harvest, Kipih reiterates her promise to help Noctis find the answers he seeks. At that moment, she receives a call from one of her colleagues, and turning back to you excitedly, she bids you and Noctis make ready for a journey on the trail of a hopeful lead."
