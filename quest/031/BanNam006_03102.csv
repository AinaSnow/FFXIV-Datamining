Though no one can say for certain whether the festival will, ultimately, save the Namazu from their terrible fate, it seems he remains hopeful. In answer to his own question, he tells you that, whether or not one's creations have an effect on the world at large, the very act of working on something is a defining one. As proof of this, Gyoshin gives you a piece of his handiwork demonstrating that you, through your actions, have forged an identity as a true friend of the Namazu─a bell just like their own."
