68,"TEXT_SUBCTS620_03139_KURENAI_000_087","Sanana's insights have been most enlightening. In seeking to usher in change, she recommends that we distribute among the citizens such articles from the surface as they will find useful in their daily lives."
69,"TEXT_SUBCTS620_03139_KURENAI_000_088","I had thought to make my case only with words, but indeed, a practical item in the hand shall prove far more convincing than any argument I could concoct.

70,"TEXT_SUBCTS620_03139_KURENAI_000_089","With no rituals of import requiring the Ruby Princess's presence in the near future, I came to Tamamizu some while ago to commence our efforts. Alas, I regret to say we've yet to make any progress..."

72,"TEXT_SUBCTS620_03139_KURENAI_000_091","That was when my thoughts turned to you, my friend. As a well-traveled adventurer, I believed that we would benefit from your aid.

73,"TEXT_SUBCTS620_03139_SANANA_000_092","Aye, anyone that's got anything to do with the House knows <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. <If(PlayerParameter(4))>She<Else/>He</If>'s one of the best contributors on our roster."

75,"TEXT_SUBCTS620_03139_SANANA_000_094","Look, I realize the House has a reputation, but we're not all ruthless, coin-hungry sorts. Not all of the time, anyway. At the end of the day we're just people, and like most people we can be driven by altruism."
76,"TEXT_SUBCTS620_03139_SANANA_000_095","And make no mistake, Sui–no–Sato needs help. Might be as the place prides itself on self-sufficiency, but the reality is grimmer than it seems. Every day, folk there are pushed to the limits of survival. And some of them...well, some of them don't make it."
77,"TEXT_SUBCTS620_03139_SANANA_000_096","It's not our intent to turn Sui–no–Sato on its head, transform it into some bustling hub like Kugane. But through trade, lives can be improved. Lives can be saved."

80,"TEXT_SUBCTS620_03139_KURENAI_000_100","Indeed. This season sees many of us struck down by a certain illness. We have not an effective treatment, and each year it inevitably claims lives."
