1,"TEXT_STMBDY321_03152_SEQ_01","Genbu of the Four Lords, the legendary auspices who serve as guardians of the Ruby Sea, has once more summoned you to their hidden sanctuary beneath Hells' Lid. Though he did not divulge his reasons, it seems likely that it relates to the impending escape of the imprisoned Koryu."
2,"TEXT_STMBDY321_03152_SEQ_02","As expected, Genbu seeks your assistance in quelling the aramitama of one of his comrades, the auspice Suzaku. However, when Genbu likens you to Tenzen, Suzaku flies into a rage, insulted by the suggestion that any mortal could ever compare to the fallen hero. Indeed, it appears there is more to this story than meets the eye..."
3,"TEXT_STMBDY321_03152_SEQ_03","Suzaku yet mourns for Tenzen, whom it seems she loved with all her heart, and despite the looming threat of Koryu's release, she is unable to move beyond her tortured past. Byakko attempts to make his ailing comrade see reason, but alas, the aramitama has driven her to the brink of madness, so much so that at times she seems to mistake you for her beloved. For a mercy, she consents to a battle that you might subdue her primal rage, but should you and yours falter, she will not hesitate to consign you to the fiery depths.

4,"TEXT_STMBDY321_03152_SEQ_04","The transformative powers of Suzaku were undeniably wondrous to behold, deadly as they were. Nevertheless, they were not enough to bewilder you and your comrades and deter you from your purpose. The auspice is once more the keeper of her soul."
5,"TEXT_STMBDY321_03152_SEQ_05","In the wake of your battle, Suzaku reflects on the man she so dearly loved─how they met and traveled the land with her fellow auspices, earning the trust and adoration of so many, only to watch helplessly as their leader fell to their greatest foe. In the cruelest of ironies, Suzaku eventually came to wield powers with which she could have saved Tenzen, and for long years she wondered what purpose fate had in mind for her, but no longer. Once more will she join forces with Genbu and Byakko to carry on her beloved's legacy and defend the realm from the forces that would destroy it."
6,"TEXT_STMBDY321_03152_SEQ_06","Genbu and the others are relieved to see that Suzaku is herself once more. Would that the same could be said for Soroban, who for the present has been transformed into a massive tortoise, perhaps by having summoned a great kami into his own body. Though the Kojin is understandably distressed, Genbu is unconcerned, and Tataru is simply annoyed to see history repeating, after a fashion. In any event, your work is done, and Soroban will probably recover. Probably."
7,"TEXT_STMBDY321_03152_SEQ_07","To his credit, Bunchin takes the news of Soroban's predicament in stride. If anything, he seems to be somewhat puzzled by the whole affair, unsure whether or not it is some sort of elaborate Eorzean joke. Humor is subjective, to say the least..."
