77,"TEXT_SUBCTS630_03177_MELODIE_000_031","First, allow me to thank you. As you may have gathered, I am─was─a maid. I served an Ishgardian nobleman, but he treated me most cruelly. Unable to bear the torment any longer, I chose to flee from his household."

82,"TEXT_SUBCTS630_03177_MELODIE_000_036","You assume rightly, Mistress Zhloe. I am well acquainted with Ishgardian cuisine, be it that partaken by highborn or low. And I am pleased to say that I'm not without skill in the kitchen. I should be glad to assist in this endeavor."

The only things we're missing now are ingredients. And utensils. And cutlery. And possibly some other trifle that hasn't occurred to me yet. Anyway, being the resourceful adventurer you are, Zhloe has no doubt that you can supply all these things!"
84,"TEXT_SUBCTS630_03177_ZHLOEALIAPOH_000_038","If we can make the Hard Place thrive again, so too will the whole of Idyllshire. That's a good thing, like pineapple pudding! Or juice! Both of which can be purchased with the scrips you can earn by contributing to this cause! I still need to ask Mistress Rowena about it, of course, but I'm sure she'll say yes. We were really, really good friends after all! As a matter of fact, Zhloe will go and speak with her right now!"
