※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESNYR601_03176_SEQ_01","Upon your inquiry as to the reason behind the nezumi bugyo's troubled demeanor, he confesses that his efforts to glorify the rat this Heavensturn have not gone to plan. It transpires that he endeavored to tempt the seafaring citizens of Limsa Lominsa with rat-made advent cakes, which they found...unappetizing, to say the least. The bugyo believes that this may be due to cultural differences, as rats are seen as harbingers of fortune in his homeland. Though you suspect food made by rats will be a hard sell regardless of what cross-cultural understanding may be established─particularly as the bugyo's word choice in describing it leaves much to be desired─you agree to ask the locals what they find so off-putting about the rodents on his behalf.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESNYR601_03176_SEQ_02","You approach Imania, a Lominsan who had previously refused the bugyo's offer of advent cakes. She makes clear that a lifetime of chasing rats <Emphasis>away</Emphasis> from her foodstuffs has not exactly endeared them to her, nor does she believe them capable of doing much more than spreading pestilence. Though she is convinced that she has the right of the matter, she indicates that you might seek out a second opinion."
3,"TEXT_FESNYR601_03176_SEQ_03","Klindrael echoes Imania's opinions on rats, but presents you one potential alternative─the Qiqirn. Though ratlike enough for your purposes, their ability to use tools is accepted fact, so the idea that they might be capable of preparing food may be more believable to the average Eorzean."
4,"TEXT_FESNYR601_03176_SEQ_04","You inquire with the Qiqirn Neneroon. He seems more than happy to assist in the nezumi bugyo's efforts, reasoning that if his people must be constantly compared to rats, it would be nice if rats at least had a decent reputation."
5,"TEXT_FESNYR601_03176_SEQ_05","Neneroon in tow, you return to speak with the bugyo, who is quite willing to work with the Qiqirn if it will further his purposes─and seems rather impressed with Neneroon, besides. Unfortunately, before you can discuss the finer details, the mochi daikan appears and begins blathering about sentient mochi. Though the idea that advent cake mochi could come alive may be difficult to swallow, it is hardly weirder than anything else going on this Heavensturn, so you take his word for it and set off to quell the glutinous uprising before it can begin."
6,"TEXT_FESNYR601_03176_SEQ_06","You and Neneroon assist in hacking the living mochi into small, bite-sized pieces, which are conveniently perfect for serving as Heavensturn advent cakes. It falls to the bugyo, however, to make the final determination as to whether they are fit for consumption according to his...specific, but not quite exacting, standards."
7,"TEXT_FESNYR601_03176_SEQ_07","Perhaps rats <Emphasis>do</Emphasis> bring good fortune, for no sooner does the nezumi bugyo finish sampling your work than does Lyngsath, head of the Culinarians' Guild and owner of the Bismarck, appear to partake of the advent cakes himself. Delighted by their simple yet impeccable flavor, he offers to mention them in his upcoming interview with the <Emphasis>Harbor Herald</Emphasis>─much to Neneroon's delight. Thus convinced that Qiqirn assistance and good publicity will help Lominsans overcome their rodent-related prejudices in no time, the bugyo declares all to be well. He leaves you with hearty thanks for your assistance, though if past experience is any indication, this year's mochi travails are not yet over..."
