※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESXMS401_03173_SEQ_01","The Starlight Celebration once again descends upon Gridania, with Amh Garanjy leading the festivities. This year, she plans to incorporate traditional Ishgardian choral singing, with presents distributed to children following the performance. Maisenta of Black Rabbit Traders has kindly offered to secure the services of a band of musicians, but little has been heard from her since. Amh Garanjy asks that you visit Maisenta at her stall to ascertain whether the concert preparations are proceeding as planned or have been beset by unforeseen difficulties.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESXMS401_03173_SEQ_02","Thankfully, it soon becomes clear that Maisenta has not forgotten about her promise to assist with the Starlight Celebration. On the other hand, she appears to have serious reservations about discussing the matter openly, and requests that the conversation be taken to a more secluded location."
3,"TEXT_FESXMS401_03173_SEQ_03","Maisenta introduces you to the Homunculi, the musicians who will be gracing the Starlight Celebration. As talented as they are, their lack of familiarity with Ishgardian choral music led them to seek the aid of a composer, rather than attempt to write the songs themselves. Unfortunately for them, the manuscripts they received state that two female and two male singers are required, with highly specific─not to mention extremely cryptic─instructions as to the tone of their voices. Since there is little time to search for experienced female vocalists, it is decided that Maisenta and Amh Garanjy will fill the roles, with Augustiniel of the Homunculi assigned as one of the two males. In addition to choosing members for the choir, it seems that Maisenta has need of someone to collect a conductor's baton from the Carpenters' Guild and an order of choir surplices from the Weavers' Guild. Since Maisenta and the Homunculi are otherwise engaged, you are left as the only available candidate for the task."
4,"TEXT_FESXMS401_03173_SEQ_04","Timbermaster Beatin has prepared an exquisitely whittled conductor's baton for use in the concert, while Redolent Rose of the Weavers' Guild has gone above and beyond the call of duty by producing even more choir surplices than requested. Both guildmasters reveal that Maisenta appears to have an excess of coin at her disposal, and has no qualms about investing it in her precious Homunculi. With the expensive wares safely in your possession, you make for Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre."
5,"TEXT_FESXMS401_03173_SEQ_05","Amh Garanjy expresses bemusement when you arrive to deliver the conductor's baton and choir surplices, and it soon becomes clear that Maisenta has neglected to share her plans with the Starlight celebrant. When Maisenta and the Homunculi arrive, they have another surprise in store for Amh Garanjy: She has been selected─without her knowledge─as a member of the choir. Maisenta pays little heed to Amh Garanjy's initial reluctance and quickly moves on to the topic of the final member. The discussion is over almost as soon as it begins with the arrival of Baenfaeld, a hulking Roegadyn with a voice so deep one might mistake it for the lowing of an immense aurochs. Thankfully, he agrees to join the choir with only minimal persuasion required. Now that all four members have been chosen, Amh Garanjy reminds the group that they still have a conductor's baton without an owner. Once again, you demonstrate a knack for being in the wrong place at the wrong time, and find yourself involuntarily volunteered for the role of directing the performance."
