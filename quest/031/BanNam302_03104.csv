49,"TEXT_BANNAM302_03104_KOFUINSEIGETSU_000_001","As you are doubtless aware, the Namazu tribe originated on this very steppe, and traces of our heritage remain to this day. The pilgrimage will involve paying visit to those spiritual locations where our ancestors once trod. Well, swam. You take my meaning."
50,"TEXT_BANNAM302_03104_KOFUINSEIGETSU_000_002","Our traditions include a particular orison: “In his whiskers' name.” Speak these words where the Hak Khaal cascades into the Sea of Blades, and at the shrine of Chakha Zoh. Of course, you are free to embellish on the prayer if you find it lacking in sophistication. I often do so myself."

55,"TEXT_BANNAM302_03104_GUARD03104_012","What that might be, I cannot imagine. Chakha Zoh enshrines the bones of the wyrmslayer Chakha, a woman bold yet wise. She was by no means an associate of the Namazu."
