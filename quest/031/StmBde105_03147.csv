1,"TEXT_STMBDE105_03147_SEQ_01","Together with Hien and Y'shtola, you make your way to the House of the Crooked Coin, resolved to determine the pillars' suitability as an energy source."
2,"TEXT_STMBDE105_03147_SEQ_02","After inspecting the pillars, Y'shtola seems satisfied that they harbor enough aether for your purposes. Whether the followers of Nhaama can be convinced to let you use them is another question. And so you head back to Mol Iloh to consult Cirina on how best to proceed."
3,"TEXT_STMBDE105_03147_SEQ_03","According to Cirina, while many Xaela tribes worship Nhaama, none are more fervent in their faith than the Dotharl. Obtaining their consent will consequently be key. While they are unlikely to grant it lightly, Hien is convinced that gaining the support of such fearless warriors will be well worth the effort. Accordingly, you set out for Dotharl Khaa to treat with the tribe's khatun, Sadu."
4,"TEXT_STMBDE105_03147_SEQ_04","In a wholly unsurprising turn of events, Sadu agrees to support Hien's cause only if you first face her in single combat. She duly bids you wait for her outside the settlement, in Nhaama's Retreat."
5,"TEXT_STMBDE105_03147_SEQ_05","Your duel has scarcely begun when Magnai─in <Emphasis>another</Emphasis> wholly unsurprising turn of events─interrupts proceedings, apparently displeased that a battle to determine the fate of the Steppe should be waged without his blessing. Incensed by Sadu's subsequent mockery, he draws his axe and charges at his Dotharl counterpart only to find Hien and Y'shtola barring his way. While they keep the Sun company, you and Sadu may resume your dance nearby."
6,"TEXT_STMBDE105_03147_SEQ_06","At the end of a furious struggle, you and your companions emerge triumphant over your respective opponents, securing the allegiance of the Dotharl and the Oronir, and sparing Hien an unsolicited initiation into the brotherhood of the Buduga. Satisfied with your work, you prepare to leave only for Magnai to accost Y'shtola wearing a curious expression. Despite trying to hack her to pieces but moments prior, the Sun is convinced that the Archon is his Nhaama, and propositions her with characteristic subtlety. Alas, his overtures are unceremoniously rejected, much to Sadu's amusement, prompting weapons to be drawn once more. Her patience spent, Y'shtola strides off back to Mol Iloh, and you and Hien follow, leaving the Xaela to their bickering."
7,"TEXT_STMBDE105_03147_SEQ_07","Cirina is pleased to hear that you have succeeded in winning over the Dotharl and the Oronir, and formally commits the Mol to Hien's nascent alliance. Though the other tribes of the Steppe must each decide for themselves, she promises to send word the moment they have given their answers."
