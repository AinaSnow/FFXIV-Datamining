69,"TEXT_STMBDE104_03146_YSHTOLA_000_100","An intriguing myth...though I wonder how Nhaama came to be woven into it. An Allagan hand, perhaps?"
70,"TEXT_STMBDE104_03146_HIEN_000_110","From here, we shall travel to Mol Iloh. There we may ask Cirina about the particulars of the myth, and raise the matter of an alliance with the rulers of the Steppe."
71,"TEXT_STMBDE104_03146_HIEN_000_118","Tell me─do you notice anything different about the Mol? How they carry themselves? That, my friend, is pride. I do believe their victory in the Naadam meant more to them than I realized."
72,"TEXT_STMBDE104_03146_YSHTOLA_000_120","So that is Cirina. Lyse told me something of the woman, but I did not think that we would ever have occasion to meet."

75,"TEXT_STMBDE104_03146_HIEN_000_141","There is a matter I would discuss with the Mol. It concerns not only the peoples of the Steppe, but of every land in the Far East."
76,"TEXT_STMBDE104_03146_CIRINA_000_142","A shard of the shining moon left behind by a wayfaring soul... And you need this to protect our lands?"
77,"TEXT_STMBDE104_03146_HIEN_000_143","I do. My friends and I wish to find the shard and ascertain the extent of its power. Will you tell me more of the place where it lies buried? This “northern crag”?"
78,"TEXT_STMBDE104_03146_CIRINA_000_144","...If that is your wish. In the mountains to the north, there is a cavern called the House of the Crooked Coin. Inside this cavern are pillars of stone that legend holds to be the source of Nhaama's power. There, I believe, you will find what you seek."
79,"TEXT_STMBDE104_03146_HIEN_000_145","Ah, yes, I know the place. 'Tis a brisk walk from here. And what are your thoughts on an alliance?"
80,"TEXT_STMBDE104_03146_CIRINA_000_146","Should the Empire return, our lands will be engulfed in a storm of conflict whether we will it or no. If we do not stand together, we will fall apart. This I believe with all my heart. However..."
81,"TEXT_STMBDE104_03146_YSHTOLA_000_147","...However?"
82,"TEXT_STMBDE104_03146_CIRINA_000_148","Among the tribes of the Steppe, there are those who revere Nhaama above all else. To them, the pillars are sacred, and not to be disturbed."
83,"TEXT_STMBDE104_03146_CIRINA_000_149","Should you proceed as you propose, such tribes are like to spurn an alliance, prompting others to follow their example. That is my concern."
84,"TEXT_STMBDE104_03146_CIRINA_000_150","But it is by no means certain that the pillars will provide the power you seek. Ere you risk the ire of the followers of Nhaama, might you not first visit the House of the Crooked Coin? If all is as you hope, we may then consider how best to earn their blessing."
85,"TEXT_STMBDE104_03146_HIEN_000_151","I thank you for your counsel. We will do as you suggest. I have no desire to give offense to those with whom I would join hands."
86,"TEXT_STMBDE104_03146_CIRINA_000_152","Thank you for your understanding. Though the Mol may reign over the Steppe today, this decision will shape the days to come, and we would not force others into war against their will."
87,"TEXT_STMBDE104_03146_HIEN_000_153","Nor we. A hundredfold stronger are they who choose to fight of their own accord."
