1,"TEXT_STMBDY504_03153_SEQ_01","Having made considerable progress with the reconstruction of the enclave, Kozakura is weighing up the possibility of reintroducing a ritual known as “tento-okuri,” in which floating paper lanterns are released into the air, drifting on the wind to guide spirits of deceased kin to the afterlife. Though the custom has not been observed since the Garlean occupation, Tsuranuki and Araragi are old enough to remember it and reveal not only further details surrounding the tradition, but a willingness to hold such an event at the One Garden. Without a moment's hesitation, they throw themselves into the preparations, persuading you and Kozakura to spread word among the locals."
2,"TEXT_STMBDY504_03153_SEQ_02","Mitsuba decides to put her activities at the Ten Thousand Stalls on hold for long enough to join in the festivities. Minazuki also expresses a similar level of enthusiasm and agrees to bring her students to participate in the tento-okuri."
3,"TEXT_STMBDY504_03153_SEQ_03","After a veritable whirlwind of activity, the preparations for the ceremony are complete. Araragi has provided countless paper lanterns while Tsuranuki, Kozakura, and the Shazenkai have succeeded in gathering almost every citizen of the enclave. Kozakura announces the start of the tento-okuri and each attendee sends lantern after lantern drifting upward, filling the sky with ephemeral beauty."
4,"TEXT_STMBDY504_03153_SEQ_04","The ceremony was an unforgettable experience for all involved. The reclamation of not only their homeland but their cultural identity gives Domans reason to be hopeful for the future. The settlement has also reached an important point in its history, as it has now become entirely self-sufficient. Your contributions to the liberation of Doma and the rejuvenation of the enclave have earned you a place among the great heroes of the realm."

50,"TEXT_STMBDY504_03153_KOZAKURA_000_002","In years gone by, Domans would honor the souls of departed kin by sending floating lanterns into the sky. This is known as “tento-okuri.”"
51,"TEXT_STMBDY504_03153_KOZAKURA_000_003","That was until the Garleans took over. Religious rites were strictly forbidden, particularly those that could be performed within the safety of one's own home."
52,"TEXT_STMBDY504_03153_KOZAKURA_000_004","Being born after the invasion, I have never experienced this myself, but restoring this custom would be another step to bringing Doma closer to its former glory.
