1,"TEXT_STMBDY701_03131_SEQ_01","Hamakaze, Confederate dogsbody, has been tasked with finding you, although it seems he had made little progress in his inquiries until you appeared unannounced in the Crick. Being the low-ranking deckswab that he is, his superior Rasho shared next to no information with him, other than to direct you to someone called Kyusei. Although the name rings no bells, there seems little harm in pursuing the matter further."
2,"TEXT_STMBDY701_03131_SEQ_02","Although Kyusei gives the impression of being courteous and well-mannered, he is reluctant to speak openly. He requests that you meet him and Rasho at the base of Heaven–on–High, presumably in order to be out of earshot of the less discreet members of the local pirating community."
3,"TEXT_STMBDY701_03131_SEQ_03","Kyusei recounts a tale in which he stumbled across a previously hidden chamber full of bizarre machinery, with which he accidentally teleported himself to the inner reaches of Heaven–on–High. Once inside, he discovered the tower was crawling with hellish beasts and was lucky to escape with his life. Rasho adds that he is keen to investigate the denizens of the tower before they find a way outside. However, the tower is considered sacred ground by the people of the Ruby Sea, and any attempts to enter it would be seen as an affront. The Confederacy can ill afford any further damage to their already questionable reputation, so Rasho asks that you, as an outsider, infiltrate the tower in secret."
4,"TEXT_STMBDY701_03131_SEQ_04","Kyusei stands guarding the hidden passage to the teleportation devices, waiting for you to begin your foray into Heaven–on–High. Before he grants you entry, he explains the magical field that permeates the tower, which threatens to stifle your strength in battle. Fortunately, this can be circumvented with the use of specially prepared empyrean aetherpool equipment, allowing the user to channel their aether rather than having it slowly drained. Armed with the tools and knowledge necessary, you are finally ready to explore the many levels of Heaven–on–High."

63,"TEXT_STMBDY701_03131_KYUSEI_000_044","The passage led to a chamber lined with an array of bizarre machinery, all glowing and humming. Against my better judgment, I reached out and touched one of the devices, and was enveloped by a blinding light."

66,"TEXT_STMBDY701_03131_RASHO_000_047","We found him sprawled out in the hidden room below the storage shed. After he came to and shared his experiences, we examined these machines he found. It turns out they are a form of gateway that leads inside Heaven–on–High. And therein lies the problem."
67,"TEXT_STMBDY701_03131_KYUSEI_000_048","Being from Eorzea, you may not be aware that this tower and the island on which it stands are regarded as sacred."
68,"TEXT_STMBDY701_03131_KYUSEI_000_049","It is believed that when the kami first came to the Ruby Sea, they created Onokoro, and built Heaven–on–High as a stairway connecting the earth and their home high above the clouds."
69,"TEXT_STMBDY701_03131_RASHO_000_050","The devout are loath to set foot on Onokoro for fear of incurring the wrath of the kami. To enter into the tower would be an even greater blasphemy."
70,"TEXT_STMBDY701_03131_RASHO_000_051","We Confederates, on the other hand, come and go as we please. Since no one else had settled on this island, we claimed it for ourselves. It takes more than a few silly folktales to scare us, after all."
71,"TEXT_STMBDY701_03131_RASHO_000_052","But imagine what might happen if people who do set store by such tales learned we had been poking around in Heaven–on–High─if they heard we were claiming that this “holy ground” was in fact filled with hellish beasts."
72,"TEXT_STMBDY701_03131_KYUSEI_000_053","At best, they may never trade with us again. And the most fanatical among them might be so bold as to come here with anger in their hearts and murder in their eyes."
73,"TEXT_STMBDY701_03131_RASHO_000_054","However, we dare not ignore the threat posed by the denizens of the tower. If Kyusei could escape, what's to stop those creatures from doing the same? Therefore I would conduct an investigation─quietly."
74,"TEXT_STMBDY701_03131_RASHO_000_055","If we dedicate large numbers of Confederates to storming the tower, it won't be long before people start asking questions.

79,"TEXT_STMBDY701_03131_RASHO_000_060","An accomplished warrior such as you should fare rather better in the tower than Kyusei did. Be not cowed by his tales. He has a flair for the dramatic."
80,"TEXT_STMBDY701_03131_KYUSEI_000_070","I take it your preparations are complete? Before you enter Heaven–on–High, I should tell you more about the magicks that Rasho mentioned."
81,"TEXT_STMBDY701_03131_KYUSEI_000_071","The scouts that we sent inside all claimed they could feel their very aether being sapped, and that their weapons were somehow robbed of their potency. Even their most forceful blows did little more than graze their enemies."

After all, I am sure that the Warrior of─ I mean, an experienced adventurer such as yourself would prefer to address more immediate concerns."
89,"TEXT_STMBDY701_03131_KYUSEI_000_100","Luckily, there is a way to circumvent the tower's magical field to some degree. Please, take this with you. It will allow you to wield what is known as an “empyrean aetherpool weapon.”"
