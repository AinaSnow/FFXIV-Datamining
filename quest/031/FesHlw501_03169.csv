0,"TEXT_FESHLW501_03169_SEQ_00","The Adventurers' Guild investigator is eyeing the troupe currently occupying Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre with suspicion.
※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESHLW501_03169_SEQ_01","The Adventurers' Guild investigator speaks to you of unsettling rumors regarding the Continental Circus's All Saints' Wake masquerade. He's heard tell of revelers going missing from the manor in which the gala is held, and given the Impresario's history of mischief─and more─thinks it prudent to further investigate these claims. For reasons related to the investigator's own lack of subtlety, it falls to you to speak with the Impresario and attempt to divine whether his intentions are malicious.

※Please note that you will not be able to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESHLW501_03169_SEQ_02","You approach the Impresario, and in the course of your conversation cannot help but notice that he is indeed plotting something sinister in order to revive the legendary Night of Devilry, though you know not what. He also appears to be concerned that someone is watching him─though not concerned enough to cease uttering his thoughts aloud, it seems. When he at last stops talking, you hear another voice, no more than a whisper, from somewhere behind you."
3,"TEXT_FESHLW501_03169_SEQ_03","Your search for the source of the mysterious voice leads you to the gates of the amphitheatre, where you once again hear its haunting words. It beckons to you in a way rather too overtly ghostly to be believable, but it's best to let it carry on while you seek its owner."
4,"TEXT_FESHLW501_03169_SEQ_04","To your surprise, the source of the voice belongs to the more chipper one of two ghost-shaped All Saints' Wake decorations, which you later learn have been magicked to life. The sort-of ghosts reveal that they are privy to the Impresario's plan─to turn party guests into pumpkins, thereby generating sufficient terror to bring about the Night of Devilry─and have also witnessed a young girl being kidnapped from the masquerade by a member of the troupe for this purpose."
5,"TEXT_FESHLW501_03169_SEQ_05","Upon hearing the tale of the kidnapped girl, the investigator immediately connects it with a report made to the Wood Wailers, and concludes that the child must be a missing girl, T'maritaa. You must work fast if you are to save her from the Impresario's clutches before she comes to harm, so the investigator encourages you to infiltrate the masquerade while he prepares a more robust rescue unit."
6,"TEXT_FESHLW501_03169_SEQ_06","You successfully pose as a party guest to enter the manor, which is remarkably thoroughly decorated for the venue of a mere ruse. Somewhere, T'maritaa is presumably being held, and where your unlikely co-conspirators await."
7,"TEXT_FESHLW501_03169_SEQ_07","Wading through the sea of jack-o'-lanterns and other garish decorations, you seek out the two non-ghosts whose acquaintance you made in Old Gridania, Little Yin and Yang. They have a notion to change your appearance to that of a fell fiend─the sort of creature that the troupe's mummers are in truth─that you may more easily extract information regarding T'maritaa's whereabouts. Little Yin gives you some time to mentally prepare, and awaits your go-ahead."
