1,"TEXT_FESSUM401_03135_SEQ_01","Another Moonfire Faire has come to Eorzea, its arrival marked by gaudy decorations and chaperones dressed in festival garb. While the event is celebrated throughout the realm, Mayaru Moyaru informs you that the main attraction awaits in Costa del Sol. However, he is suspiciously secretive as to the nature of this attraction, and it seems you will have to go and see it for yourself.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."

Haermaga, the grand chaperone of the Moonfire Faire, reveals that they form an obstacle course, the centerpiece of this year's festivities. The event organizers believe that the sight of Adventurers' Guild members risking life and limb to complete an increasingly difficult series of challenges will inspire the younger generation to one day become adventurers themselves. Haermaga waits patiently while you summon the courage needed to become an Eorzean Nimble Warrior."

The older sibling states his intention to face the Eorzean Nimble Warrior course. However, only members of the Adventurers' Guild are allowed to enter. Despite lacking the necessary credentials, R'fhul Tia is able to convince Haermaga to bend the rules, on the condition that you go first to demonstrate the correct method for completing the course. Beaudefoin the chaperone stands at the foot of the wooden behemoth, ready to give the next set of instructions."
