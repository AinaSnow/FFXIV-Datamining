1,"TEXT_STMBDZ510_02761_SEQ_01","Gascot enlists your aid to find out more about how Qestir communicate with each other. Rather surprisingly, he is actually aware of his less-than-favorable reputation amongst the locals and feels your help is vital. You agree to lend him a hand and question the Au Ra in Reunion on his behalf."
2,"TEXT_STMBDZ510_02761_SEQ_02","Some of the locals are not especially keen to help when it becomes apparent you are assisting Gascot. However, you are still able to learn a few facts concerning Qestiri customs. Namely, that Reunion is a place where all Xaela put their tribal rivalries to one side to interact peacefully, and that the Qestir really do not ever speak."
3,"TEXT_STMBDZ510_02761_SEQ_03","Gascot listens to you intently as you share what you have learned. Taking to heart the idea that actions speak louder than words, Gascot resolves to greet everyone in the village, and asks that you meet with Cotota to earn her trust."
4,"TEXT_STMBDZ510_02761_SEQ_04","As instructed by Gascot, you approach Cotota in the hopes of gaining her trust. She initially seems confused by your approach, and just as you feel you are on the verge of a breakthrough, you are interrupted by none other than the blundering merchant himself. Gascot unleashes his interpretation of the Bomb Dance on his unsuspecting victims inside the khan's tent. Their response to this disturbance of the peace is unsurprisingly rather negative. Gascot bids you leave the area and regroup to consider just what went wrong."
5,"TEXT_STMBDZ510_02761_SEQ_05","While Gascot is aware his dance did not go down well, he is perplexed as to why. Supposedly he received a very favorable reception when he performed it in front of several Qestiri onlookers earlier. Regardless, he notes that the experience has at least taught him something about the local culture and he shall continue his endeavor to find a way of effectively expressing himself."

55,"TEXT_STMBDZ510_02761_BAIDUR_000_021","The Qestir refuse to speak. They think all words to be lies. If you wish to earn their trust then simply follow this principle. It should be clear what you need to do."
