51,"TEXT_STMBDZ318_02714_KANSUI_000_003","As soon as I made to approach her, however, she took to the waters and disappeared in the direction of Onokoro. My father insists it was simply a dream, but I know better. This lovely lady─she is a pirate, I am certain of it."

53,"TEXT_STMBDZ318_02714_KANSUI_000_005","She was so gorgeous she looked like something out of a dream but she was real. She is out there somewhere, and I must find her."
