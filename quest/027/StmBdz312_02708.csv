52,"TEXT_STMBDZ312_02708_LADYTURTLE02708_000_011","Treasures are often carried into the areas surrounding our village by the ocean currents and become entangled in the roots and stalks of larger clumps of plants like those."
53,"TEXT_STMBDZ312_02708_LADYTURTLE02708_000_012","If you do a bit of tugging on the stalks and rummage about the roots, treasure should appear! Go ahead, and give it a try!"

56,"TEXT_STMBDZ312_02708_LADYTURTLE02708_000_021","Please go and search the waters near Sui–no–Sato and to the rear of our village. I shall poke about the other areas."

59,"TEXT_STMBDZ312_02708_LADYTURTLE02708_000_031","You have brought back a bounty of porcelain plates, bottles and look─this is a torn zabuton cushion! This is one of the rarer treasures I have possessed to date!"
60,"TEXT_STMBDZ312_02708_LADYTURTLE02708_000_032","Ah, but you bore of this talk. After all, your kind only has an eye for koban. That you would not desire to own such exquisite objects─you are a very strange people, indeed."
61,"TEXT_STMBDZ312_02708_LADYTURTLE02708_000_033","I suppose, however, I must be thankful for it because that means all the more treasure for us! Haha! Thank you for your help in gathering these for me, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>madam<Else/>sir</If>. I cannot wait to take them home!"
