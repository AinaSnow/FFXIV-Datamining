50,"TEXT_STMBDZ418_02741_GYOKU_000_002","Long ago, this manor belonged to a magistrate of Doma. Back then, we Namazu served under him. But in truth we were more friends than servants."

55,"TEXT_STMBDZ418_02741_GYOKU_000_007","Those three drunkard Namazu must be out there somewhere. Go and find them, and dump that muddy water on them when you do. That should serve to sober their senses."

69,"TEXT_STMBDZ418_02741_GYOKU_000_031","Still, it is hard to fault them entirely. Tea is a lovely drink. It tingles as it goes down, and then you feel your entire body relax. Such a remarkably good feeling. "
70,"TEXT_STMBDZ418_02741_GYOKU_000_032","No Namazu can see to work when they drink it. That is why we sought to outlaw it. But as you can imagine, that only had the opposite effect. Yes, yes."
71,"TEXT_STMBDZ418_02741_GYOKU_000_033","This all reminds me, our dear magistrate often said with a smile that a Namazu with tea was much like a man with wine."
