1,"TEXT_STMBDZ308_02704_SEQ_01","Kurenai attempts to tell you the truth but is unsure of where to begin. She asks that you accompany her to where the Ruby Princess is resting, believing that looking upon her visage will make it a little easier for you to understand what she is about to explain."
2,"TEXT_STMBDZ308_02704_SEQ_02","Kurenai has Shiosai bring out the Ruby Princess, and together they disclose that she is, in fact, Hisui─lady-in-waiting to the true Ruby Princess, who is none other than Kurenai herself. When guests from the outside were invited into the palace to conduct a secret ceremony, Hisui had assumed the Ruby Princess's identity to prevent any danger from befalling the true heiress to the throne. As such, when proceedings took a dark turn, it was Hisui who became possessed by the void spirits that were summoned, leading to her current comatose state. Upon revealing this to you, Kurenai announces her intention to leave Sui–no–Sato for the upper world in search of a cure for Hisui. Shiosai, who has been ordered to stay behind, begs you go with her."
3,"TEXT_STMBDZ308_02704_SEQ_03","Kurenai is overjoyed to learn that you will be accompanying her on her journey outside of Sui–no–Sato. It seems the fates of both the Ruby Princess and her dearest friend, Hisui, now rest squarely upon your shoulders."
