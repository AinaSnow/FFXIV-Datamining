1,"TEXT_STMBDZ604_02782_SEQ_01","Esugen, the Dawn Throne culinarian, is in quite the predicament. Halfway through preparing food to feed the hungry Oroniri warriors, he realizes he has forgotten to obtain a key ingredient─sheep's milk. Were he to go and fetch this himself, he would fall behind schedule and find himself at the mercy of fifty hot-blooded, hungry men. To prevent any delays in serving the food, he asks that you go and bring back the milk of three sheep for him. He then directs you to speak with Sorocan to do just that."
2,"TEXT_STMBDZ604_02782_SEQ_02","Sorocan is appalled to learn that Esugen sent you to milk sheep in his stead and is convinced that he is attempting to shirk his responsibilities. Nevertheless, she allows you to proceed to the pen and collect sheep milk."
3,"TEXT_STMBDZ604_02782_SEQ_03","You approach three sheep and manage to fill all three of the pails full of milk, just as Esugen requested. Deliver them to the Oroniri culinarian."
4,"TEXT_STMBDZ604_02782_SEQ_04","Shortly after delivering the pails of milk to Esugen, the two of you are joined by a young man named Kuzuku, who seems to have come solely to taunt the local culinarian. Once he leaves, Esugen turns to you and reveals that as the weakest man in the village, he occupies the bottom rung in the Oroniri hierarchy. He, however, intends to become strong enough to rise from his lowly position, and asks that you help him with his cooking on occasion that he might find the time to train."

49,"TEXT_STMBDZ604_02782_ESUGEN_000_001","Alas, as the Oronir's only culinarian, time is a rare commodity. I must keep all fifty of our warriors fed. Thankfully, now that the meat has been cut and the entrails soaked, all that is left for me to do is─ Bah! I am out of sheep's milk!"
50,"TEXT_STMBDZ604_02782_ESUGEN_000_002","This is a disaster! If I leave to milk sheep now, I will fall behind on cooking, and the starved masses are sure to lynch me upon their return!"

55,"TEXT_STMBDZ604_02782_ESUGEN_000_005","Upon receiving Sorocan's blessing to do so, you can begin milking the sheep. Please, fill up three pails and bring them back to me as fast as you can!"

59,"TEXT_STMBDZ604_02782_ESUGEN_000_012","<sigh> It is, however, something that has become increasingly difficult to do of late. The number of hungry mouths I must feed grows by the day, but I remain our only culinarian."
