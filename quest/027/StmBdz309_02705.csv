1,"TEXT_STMBDZ309_02705_SEQ_01","The Ruby Princess would like to look into the origins of a peculiar faerie tale regarding a sea-faring fisherman and a princess who had been plunged into a years-long slumber. She believes the island of Onokoro holds some of the answers she seeks."
2,"TEXT_STMBDZ309_02705_SEQ_02","You seek out the princess, who has been approached by one of the natives of the island─a Confederate pirate. While he starts to get a bit smart with you, it does not take long for him to recognize exactly who you are. Brushing it off as a joke, he then urges you to speak with a fisherman who comes to visit the island once a year. According to the pirate this man knows a great deal about faerie tales, and is currently docked at the Quickscape Pier."
3,"TEXT_STMBDZ309_02705_SEQ_03","As the fisherman tells it: long ago a Kojin of the Blue was saved from certain death by a Hyuran fisherman. The grateful Kojin rewarded this man with the promise of an adventure and a vial of liquid that would allow him to breathe indefinitely underwater. Following him to the depths of the seas, the fisherman and Kojin traveled together, eventually coming across a princess who had been asleep for years in her palace. The Kojin, seeing this, produced another vial that instantly woke the princess. Hearing this story, Kurenai concludes the palace mentioned in the faerie tale is Shisui of the Violet Tides and would like to return to Sui–no–Sato to conduct further investigations."
4,"TEXT_STMBDZ309_02705_SEQ_04","Kurenai and you are joined by Shiosai, the overseer. After informing him of all that you have learned from your trip to the surface, he reveals that one of the ancient stories of Sui–no–Sato spoke of a Ruby Princess who wed a Hyuran man. Suspecting that the fisherman's faerie tale is closer to an account of historical events, Kurenai would like to travel with you to Tamamizu to ask the Kojin of the Blue about the elixir for eternal sleep."
