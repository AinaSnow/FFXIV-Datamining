1,"TEXT_STMBDZ511_02762_SEQ_01","In light of Gascot's dance failing to capture the locals' hearts and minds, he suggests you try a different approach: improving his reputation with the other tribes first. Gascot believes advertising his wares in Reunion to a range of tribes will increase the demand for his goods, putting pressure on the Qestir to allow him to trade. You agree to help promote his goods to the Au Ra that have only recently come to Reunion."
2,"TEXT_STMBDZ511_02762_SEQ_02","A Gesi by the name of Jebei shows he is quite interested in trading with Gascot. He explains that his tribe values hunting above all else and would have use for Gascot's foreign weapons. You are also told that the Qestir are in constant need of oil to keep the lamps of Reunion alight. In light of this, Jebei encourages you to retrieve a lump of fat from a steppe gedan and present it to Cotota as a gesture of goodwill."
3,"TEXT_STMBDZ511_02762_SEQ_03","Having slain the beast mentioned by Jebei and collected its fat, you make your way back to Reunion to present the spoils to Gascot."
4,"TEXT_STMBDZ511_02762_SEQ_04","Gascot is pleased to see your venture was a success. He states that Jebei gave him some choice advice while you were away and that he is quite keen to follow it. You are bid to go and hand over the beast fat to Cotota on Gascot's behalf."
5,"TEXT_STMBDZ511_02762_SEQ_05","Cotota seems puzzled to see you again. You hand her the fat and explain the reason for your visit. However, her reaction is far from positive, and you cannot help but wonder if Jebei's advice to Gascot is somehow to blame."
