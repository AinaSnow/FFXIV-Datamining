49,"TEXT_LUCKMA306_03296_ALISAIE_000_001","These marks on your map are where the usual trouble spots are."
50,"TEXT_LUCKMA306_03296_ALISAIE_000_002","You can assume that any beast with a white hide or carapace is a sin eater, but you'll know for sure soon enough when they come slavering after your aether. Remember: it's kill or be killed with these monsters."

53,"TEXT_LUCKMA306_03296_ALISAIE_000_011","Ah, I thought there might be one or two lurking on the fringes. Nothing out of the ordinary for this area..."
54,"TEXT_LUCKMA306_03296_ALISAIE_000_012","I expect you noticed it yourself, but individually, these lesser sin eaters are no more deadly than any natural predator you might encounter in the desert."
55,"TEXT_LUCKMA306_03296_ALISAIE_000_013","It's when they appear in numbers that they pose a threat. Much like the voidsent, they have an unfortunate tendency to flock to the strongest of their kind."
56,"TEXT_LUCKMA306_03296_ALISAIE_000_014","Thus when a powerful sin eater goes on the hunt, it might be attended by a veritable swarm of weaker kin. Imagine an army of such creatures descending on a village or hamlet..."
57,"TEXT_LUCKMA306_03296_ALISAIE_000_015","That's the basic idea behind my patrols: to cull their ranks often enough that their numbers won't be overwhelming when the big ones come out to play. And you've certainly helped on that front."
