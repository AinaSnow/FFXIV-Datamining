0,"TEXT_LUCKBA321_03275_SEQ_00","Lue-Reeq is, as usual, quite pleased to see you again."
1,"TEXT_LUCKBA321_03275_SEQ_01","Another of Lue-Reeq's hirelings has provided him with new information concerning a sighting of Andreia on Kholusia. It would seem that the Virtue has transformed yet another deadly mark into a sin eater─this time a great bear. And so it falls to Reeq and <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> to slay yet another newborn fiend."
2,"TEXT_LUCKBA321_03275_SEQ_02","As before, the plan is simple: seek out and slay the eater and hope that in so doing you happen to encounter its creator. As before, Lue-Reeq declares that the most effective course of action would be to search separately."
3,"TEXT_LUCKBA321_03275_SEQ_03","It would not be an engaging hunt if you found your quarry that quickly, and so it is premature to declare this particular one a failure. Probably..."
4,"TEXT_LUCKBA321_03275_SEQ_04","You continue your search for a time, but it gradually becomes apparent that it is a fool's endeavor. The bear is clearly nowhere to be seen, and it is past time you and Lue-Reeq reconsidered your plan."
5,"TEXT_LUCKBA321_03275_SEQ_05","You find Lue-Reeq in the company of several other hunters who apparently managed to track down and kill the bear before you could. Their leader, Lanbyrd, is a former associate of Lue-Reeq's it would seem, until the pair had a falling out, leading Lanbyrd to strike out on his own. Being familiar with his former partner's methods, he surmised that by bribing his hirelings to share their findings with him first, he could beat the Mystel hunter to the punch, and sure enough, he managed to do just that. And so you prepare to quit Kholusia, but not before paying a brief visit to Eulmore at Lue-Reeq's behest."
6,"TEXT_LUCKBA321_03275_SEQ_06","As a courtesy─or perhaps simply to let them know that he's getting on well enough─Lue-Reeq attempts to introduce you to his lord father, a wealthy Eulmoran who cares for naught but his indulgences like so many others. Indeed, his attempt fails spectacularly, as the aristocrat hardly spares a glance for his son or for you, and states that he should speak with his manservant if he is in dire need of more coin. In a fit of emotion, Lue-Reeq storms off, and so you accompany him back to the Crystarium."
7,"TEXT_LUCKBA321_03275_SEQ_07","Lue-Reeq confesses to you what most others have already surmised: that he was born into privilege as a child of a Eulmoran free citizen. Raised without want or worry, he has since grown tired of the lackadaisical city life, and so he came to the Crystarium that he might become a bounty hunter─a quest that henceforth may be that much more difficult given that he refused to take more of his father's coin. However, you reassure him that this need not be cause to end your partnership. At least, not immediately.

※The next role quest will be available from Lue-Reeq upon reaching level 76 in any physical DPS class."

68,"TEXT_LUCKBA321_03275_LUEREEQ_000_050","You have questions, I am sure. As you may have surmised, Lanbyrd was once a comrade of mine. I took him into my service that we might hone our skills battling sin eaters in preparation for facing Andreia."
69,"TEXT_LUCKBA321_03275_LUEREEQ_000_051","However, I soon came to see that he was not all that capable of a hunter, and so I dissolved our working relationship. Unfortunately, he did not take it in stride, and instead resolved to recruit new companions that he might beat me at my own game..."

84,"TEXT_LUCKBA321_03275_LUEREEQ_000_070","Forgive me, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, but I would forgo the wine on this occasion. Father's lackluster reception has put me in rather dour spirits."

89,"TEXT_LUCKBA321_03275_LUEREEQ_000_075","Alas, in a fit of frustration, I refused Father's coin. Without additional resources, we have no choice but to conduct the search by ourselves..."
