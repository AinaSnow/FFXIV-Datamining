63,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_TISTABIE_000_046","The deck holds nine cards, with the pictures printed thereon representing the numbers one through nine. Each number appears only once in the deck, so there are no repeats."

100,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_ATHARN_000_112","The Eulmoran Army may be the very essence of military might, but even our forces saw grievous losses in the war against the sin eaters."

102,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_ATHARN_000_114","He's got this way with the eaters, you see─turns them docile as house cats. I wouldn't be exaggerating to say they've become something of an ally to Eulmore. No longer an enemy to be feared."

110,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_ALPHINAUD_000_134","I've put together an ensemble out of the garments you chose. Is this satisfactory?"

114,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_A3_000_138","What happened to painting?"
115,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_A3_000_139","I don't recall this part of the artistic process..."
116,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_CHAINUZZ_000_140","Exactly! The lad is an artist, dearest, not a dress-up doll. It's about time we set him to work for the reason we called him here!"
117,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_DULIACHAI_000_141","...Must we? I do love a good painting, but I thought since we were enjoying ourselves so thoroughly..."
118,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_CHAINUZZ_000_142","Well, I'd not─ That is to say, as long as you..."
119,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_CHAINUZZ_000_143","Ugh. Just...make sure you give the lad time to prepare. We know who'll be upset if he's not ready to paint at a moment's notice."
120,"TEXT_LUCKMA207_03288_DULIACHAI_000_144","Whatever you say, darling. So! Shall we pick out some jewelry, next!?"
