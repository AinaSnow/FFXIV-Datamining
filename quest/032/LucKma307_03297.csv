53,"TEXT_LUCKMA307_03297_TESLEEN_000_014","While we do that, could you tend to a few patients, perhaps? There are three in particular I meant to visit─it's just a matter of saying a few words to them, and seeing that their skin isn't caked in sand."

78,"TEXT_LUCKMA307_03297_RHONRON_000_093","Hm... Given how richly you cracked your coinpurse with me, I <Emphasis>might</Emphasis> still owe you food... Here, take this one! Free of charge!"
79,"TEXT_LUCKMA307_03297_ALISAIE_000_094","Gods, I've never seen a Mord merchant give away something for nothing before. How much coin did you spend here...?"

91,"TEXT_LUCKMA307_03297_ALISAIE_000_130","I'm glad I was able to show you that. When it comes to understanding the catastrophe which befell the First, one glimpse of the empty wasteland beyond the wall is worth more than an hour of Urianger's lecturing."
92,"TEXT_LUCKMA307_03297_ALISAIE_000_131","And I needed you to know beyond a doubt that Tesleen has no other choice. The nectarine will be a kindness."
93,"TEXT_LUCKMA307_03297_ALISAIE_000_132","It isn't just the threat posed to others... When a person becomes an eater, the pain appears to be excruciating."
94,"TEXT_LUCKMA307_03297_ALISAIE_000_133","The carers are truly fond of their wards, and would spare them that suffering. It is their way of fighting back against a fate worse than death."
95,"TEXT_LUCKMA307_03297_ALISAIE_000_135","Go ahead. I think she's been waiting for us."
96,"TEXT_LUCKMA307_03297_TESLEEN_000_140","You're back. I hope you had a nice time. Did you...manage to find a nectarine?"
97,"TEXT_LUCKMA307_03297_TESLEEN_000_141","Thank you. Alisaie's explained why I wanted this, has she? I can see it in your eyes."
98,"TEXT_LUCKMA307_03297_TESLEEN_000_142","But we may not need it just yet. I spoke with the others, and we've decided to keep an eye on Halric for now."
