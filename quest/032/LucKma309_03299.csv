55,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_ALISAIE_000_013","Hurt...? There wasn't even a fight. I was too late. Too <Emphasis>slow</Emphasis>.
And I thought I could protect you..."

64,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_ALISAIE_000_022","I have a destination in mind, yes. And a purpose."
65,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_ALISAIE_000_023","This damned Light, building without cease... It's the reason we can't save those corrupted by the eaters."
66,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_ALISAIE_000_024","But what if we corrected the balance? Even if it were only little by little─even if it took <Emphasis>years</Emphasis>─it would surely make things better."

69,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_ALISAIE_000_027","We should return to the Crystarium. I may not be able to repel the eaters on my own...but I can still use the skills I have gained here to hurt them."

73,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_ALISAIE_000_051","But I was serious about what I said. While the men and women at the Inn battle against this blight with kindness, I must fight it in my own way. With steel."

81,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_CASSARD_000_060","Ah, it's good to be back. Mord Souq has many charms, but there's nothing like a proper bed to recover from a long journey...as I'm sure you'd agree."
82,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_ALISAIE_000_070","Ugh, remind me to wear goggles if we ever fly over Amh Araeng again. I've barely gotten the sand out of my eyes."

84,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_ALISAIE_000_072","I think I'm ready to meet with the Exarch. We need to talk about how we're going to wipe the sin eaters out. Shall we?"

...I was tempted to set off again the moment we had decided upon a direction, but you have still to visit Alphinaud, haven't you?"
88,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_ALISAIE_000_091","And if I know my brother, he'll be on the cusp of discovering something vital to our success─if he hasn't already. I'm content to stay here and consider our options for the time being─but don't keep me waiting too long, eh?"
89,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_ALISAIE_000_092","Thank you for seeking me out, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>─it meant a lot to have you there at my side. And looking at Alphinaud, I'd say he's as eager to begin this discussion as I am."
90,"TEXT_LUCKMA309_03299_ALISAIE_000_093","I say we lay our experiences before the Exarch, and step back to see what kind of picture they make. Then we can decide where to go from here."
