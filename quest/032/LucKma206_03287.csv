81,"TEXT_LUCKMA206_03287_LADY03287_000_086","Mayhap in another society, our different standing would breed prejudice or resentment. But in Eulmore, a most glorious measure is in place to avert such unpleasantness."
82,"TEXT_LUCKMA206_03287_LADY03287_000_087","Part of that measure requires that the free surrender their fortunes. Upon registration, all of our property─financial, intellectual, or otherwise─is given over to the city."
