0,"TEXT_LUCKBA221_03269_SEQ_00","Giott is eyeing you. Presumably. It's a bit hard to tell."
1,"TEXT_LUCKBA221_03269_SEQ_01","You find Giott where you expected─deep in a mug of ale. Though neither one of you has had any sudden epiphanies as to how to defeat Sophrosyne, Giott has at least come up with a means of furthering your investigation into its enigmatic restorative powers. The dwarf reasons that by testing your own healing skills on a sin eater, it may be possible to suss out what differentiates the Virtue's magic from your own."
2,"TEXT_LUCKBA221_03269_SEQ_02","You proceed to Mord Souq, a settlement near which stray eaters have allegedly been sighted. What you sight instead is Giott, imbibing a sinister concoction that the dwarf affectionately refers to as “Mord swill.” Though you do not ask, Giott nevertheless explains that a healthy diet of alcohol serves to improve dwarven battle readiness, and rushes off to prove it, leaving you with a half-empty bottle of allegedly potable liquid."
3,"TEXT_LUCKBA221_03269_SEQ_03","You learn from the Mord peddler selling the stuff that other races do not generally imbibe their signature beverage, which does not come as a surprise. With the matter of the swill settled, you depart in pursuit of Giott."
4,"TEXT_LUCKBA221_03269_SEQ_04","You find Giott alongside the somewhat worse-for-wear body of an eater. The time has come to attempt what no sinner has ever had cause to do before, and heal it."
5,"TEXT_LUCKBA221_03269_SEQ_05","As expected, your magic has no effect on the sin eater, which remains limp and motionless before you. You can only conclude that traditional healing is fundamentally incompatible with sin eaters, which are in truth lifeless, if animated, husks. The question of how Sophrosyne's power is able to resurrect them anyway remains, however."
6,"TEXT_LUCKBA221_03269_SEQ_06","You return to the Crystarium, where Giott has come to reside in the usual spot. The dwarf is apparently in the midst of pondering what you have learned thus far, but has yet to arrive at any sort of conclusion, and so invites you to tend to your own affairs in the meantime.

※The next role quest will be available from Giott upon reaching level 76 in any healer class."

83,"TEXT_LUCKBA221_03269_GIOTT_000_202","You're right on that one. Sin eaters may look like people or beasts, but it's like they're just pretending. They're not truly alive."
84,"TEXT_LUCKBA221_03269_GIOTT_000_203","Hmmm... My expertise is more in hacking and slashing, but don't most healing magic use aether to tap into creatures' own vitality? Give it a boost, fill in what's missing─that sort of thing? But sin eaters ain't alive like you and me."
85,"TEXT_LUCKBA221_03269_GIOTT_000_204","Only the Light drives them─keeps 'em going like winding an automaton. And healing magic ain't meant for restoring life to something that didn't have none to begin with."
86,"TEXT_LUCKBA221_03269_GIOTT_000_205","But if Sophrosyne's power ain't like the healing magic we know, what <Emphasis>is</Emphasis> it?"
87,"TEXT_LUCKBA221_03269_GIOTT_000_206","I also wonder why it don't come and revive this one. Is it just too far away to take notice?"
88,"TEXT_LUCKBA221_03269_GIOTT_000_207","Then again... I never heard tell of it appearing at Holminster Switch, neither, and so many sin eaters got killed there that you'd think it would take note eventually."

93,"TEXT_LUCKBA221_03269_GIOTT_000_252","Speaking of─would it kill you to relax a little? Being so serious all of the time can't be good for you. And the silent staring just makes you seem morose."
94,"TEXT_LUCKBA221_03269_GIOTT_000_253","We won't kill Sophrosyne any faster for <Emphasis>not</Emphasis> drinking, that's for sure. Nothing comes easy to sober folks."
95,"TEXT_LUCKBA221_03269_GIOTT_000_254","...And that's why I need a few more in me before I can really get to work figuring out why Sophrosyne does what it does. I keep feeling like I'm missing something obvious, but...hmm."
