0,"TEXT_LUCKRA105_03259_SEQ_00","Ryne and Urianger are considering the next step in the plan to reclaim the Empty."
1,"TEXT_LUCKRA105_03259_SEQ_01","Having successfully revitalized the Empty's water-aspected aether, Urianger suggests using the same methods again with the element of earth, in the hope that nutrient-rich soil will allow plants to grow. No one is more eager to carry out this plan than Ryne, who leads the way to Eden's core."
2,"TEXT_LUCKRA105_03259_SEQ_02","In order to contain the earth-aspected aether, Urianger asks that you use your recollections of Titan as a focal point. As was the case in your earlier encounter with Leviathan, this particular incarnation is likely to differ considerably from the Lord of Crags you fought all those moons ago.

※Eden's Gate: Sepulture can be accessed via the Duty Finder."
3,"TEXT_LUCKRA105_03259_SEQ_03","Though the Titan you summon bears little resemblance to the primal worshipped by the kobolds, he is no less formidable, and tests the limits of your abilities. Following your hard-fought victory, Ryne is keen to hear how the being called forth from the Empty compares to the foe you once faced on the Source."
4,"TEXT_LUCKRA105_03259_SEQ_04","Ryne guides Eden back to the camp, optimistic that the influx of revitalized aether has led to further alterations in the Empty. The area surrounding the lake has undergone a dramatic transformation, with immense, rocky outcrops having appeared as if from nowhere. However, the change seems to have only affected a relatively small region, though according to Urianger, this is most likely due to the aetherial currents intersecting at this point, and posits that similar phenomena may be occurring elsewhere. Though there is reason to be optimistic, the conversation is cut short when Ryne suddenly drops to her knees, apparently overcome by sheer exhaustion."

49,"TEXT_LUCKRA105_03259_THANCRED_000_001","You know, when I first heard Urianger's plan, I didn't know what to expect. But then that enormous crystal appeared and water came gushing forth and, well..."
50,"TEXT_LUCKRA105_03259_RYNE_000_010","I think this proves that the water-aspected aether is no longer lying dormant. So, which element should we realign next, Urianger?"
51,"TEXT_LUCKRA105_03259_URIANGER_000_011","I propose earth. Should we succeed in returning the soil's life-giving energy, the Empty shall become capable of supporting the growth of flora."

54,"TEXT_LUCKRA105_03259_THANCRED_200_012","Still sound asleep. She didn't so much as stir even when I took her helmet off. I thought it might be getting a bit stuffy in there, and I was curious to know what sort of person we're dealing with."
55,"TEXT_LUCKRA105_03259_THANCRED_300_012","She seems surprisingly normal, not at all like your usual voidsent. I'd say she's around the same age as you, Ryne, perhaps a little older."
56,"TEXT_LUCKRA105_03259_RYNE_400_012","Well, whoever she is, we should let her rest while we concentrate on the task at hand."
57,"TEXT_LUCKRA105_03259_THANCRED_000_013","As much as I'd love to go with you, I'd best stay here in case she wakes up and is feeling less than cooperative."

63,"TEXT_LUCKRA105_03259_URIANGER_000_031","I would suggest a certain region that lieth east of Norvrandt which was once home to the great Mount Atlas."
64,"TEXT_LUCKRA105_03259_URIANGER_000_032","And for the earth-aspected primal we wish to invoke, what could be a more fitting choice than Titan?"

71,"TEXT_LUCKRA105_03259_RYNE_000_060","But if our last battle is anything to go by, this one will be different from the Titan that <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> remembers, yes?"

90,"TEXT_LUCKRA105_03259_RYNE_000_110","So all it would've taken is a momentary lapse of concentration? I don't like the sound of that."
91,"TEXT_LUCKRA105_03259_RYNE_000_120","But more importantly, you've defeated another elemental being, which means we're a step closer to reclaiming the Empty."
