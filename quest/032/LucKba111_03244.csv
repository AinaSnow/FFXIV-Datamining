1,"TEXT_LUCKBA111_03244_SEQ_01","Granson knows better than to simply venture out into the wilds of Norvrandt without any inkling of where to search for his prey. Thus he would have you travel to the village of Wright on Kholusia, a humble settlement that was once attacked by Dikaiosyne, that you might gather information to aid you in your hunt."
2,"TEXT_LUCKBA111_03244_SEQ_02","The bounty hunter seems to possess a connection to the village, though he refrains from elaborating for the present. For now, you are to split up and question the residents of Wright in an effort to learn more about your quarry."
3,"TEXT_LUCKBA111_03244_SEQ_03","Regrettably, the villagers with whom you speak are reluctant to discuss the fateful day which haunts them still. In light of this, it seems rather unlikely that Granson will have obtained any information of value..."
4,"TEXT_LUCKBA111_03244_SEQ_04","Although Granson's inquiries were equally unproductive, he is at least finally willing to reveal his connection to the village─his village, it would seem. A year ago, he was still a humble game hunter living happily with his bride-to-be, a goldsmith who had been hard at work restoring an antique bracelet. Alas, when he returned from the shipyards with supplies for her work, he found the village in disarray, for Dikaiosyne had come and set about killing and corrupting all who crossed his path─including Milinda, Granson's beloved, who was transformed into a sin eater before his very eyes. Afterwards, Dikaiosyne wordlessly scooped up the antique bracelet and quit the village with his horde of eater followers, but not before the hunter was forced to put Milinda out of her misery. It was this tragedy which set Granson on the path he now walks, for only by taking his revenge on the eater which destroyed his life will his soul ever know peace.

※The next role quest will be available from Granson upon reaching level 74 in any tank class."

51,"TEXT_LUCKBA111_03244_GRANSON_000_004","So we'll start by asking around a place I know for a fact Dikaiosyne has attacked before. The village of Wright, on Kholusia."

73,"TEXT_LUCKBA111_03244_GRANSON_000_155","Was about a year ago that she accepted a commission from this Eulmoran trader─bloke dealt mostly in antiques, and he had this bracelet in need of restoration."
74,"TEXT_LUCKBA111_03244_GRANSON_000_156","Bloody old with a questionable provenance, but supposedly it once belonged to royalty or some such. The Fangs of Orthus, he called it."
75,"TEXT_LUCKBA111_03244_GRANSON_000_157","Me and her'd been talking about tying the proverbial knot─buying land, building a home, that sort of thing. Around here that might not take much, but it was still a lot more than we had, so when the trader made his offer, she didn't hesitate to say yes."
76,"TEXT_LUCKBA111_03244_GRANSON_000_158","I'd gone down to the shipyards to pick up extra tools and materials she needed for the work. Quality stuff, but it'd pay for itself ten times over. But when I got back to Wright..."

89,"TEXT_LUCKBA111_03244_GRANSON_000_171","I carved the scars in my flesh to mirror the ones he left on my soul. An enduring reminder of the vow that I never dare stray from the path."
90,"TEXT_LUCKBA111_03244_GRANSON_000_172","...There. All done. No need to wallow in it. Wouldn't want my tragic yet trite tale to put you off our hunt. Still with me to the end, sinner?"
91,"TEXT_LUCKBA111_03244_GRANSON_000_173","That's the spirit. Still, I've some unfinished business here, so if you could give me a moment before we resume, I would be most grateful."
