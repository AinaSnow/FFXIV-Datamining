1,"TEXT_LUCKMA201_03282_SEQ_01","In order to facilitate your reunion with Alphinaud, the Exarch offers to arrange transportation for the journey to Kholusia. He hands you a folded letter, and asks that you present it to Szem Djenmai, the Master of Beasts at Temenos Rookery."
2,"TEXT_LUCKMA201_03282_SEQ_02","After perusing your letter of introduction, Szem Djenmai not only agrees to provide you with an amaro, but also insists upon accompanying you on the first leg of your trip. He bids you gather your gear and head to the Amaro Launch, where one of the younger tamers will attend to you while Szem is saddling the mounts."
3,"TEXT_LUCKMA201_03282_SEQ_03","Despite obvious doubts as to your skill as a rider, the young tamer nevertheless trusts in Master Djenmai's decision to grant you the use of his amaro. Your journey to Kholusia has begun."
4,"TEXT_LUCKMA201_03282_SEQ_04","After a blissfully uneventful flight, you alight upon the island. Szem waits patiently nearby as you find your land legs."
5,"TEXT_LUCKMA201_03282_SEQ_05","According to your guide, it is not the wildlife of Kholusia that should concern you, but its people. Once satisfied that you have heeded his warning regarding the Eulmorans, the Zun promises to tell you something that will aid you in your search for Alphinaud..."

61,"TEXT_LUCKMA201_03282_SZEMDJENMAI_000_019","That's right. Mounts like my grey friend over there are a common sight in these parts."
62,"TEXT_LUCKMA201_03282_SZEMDJENMAI_000_020","But I gather you hail from further afield. More accustomed to chocobos, perchance? I hear there are a few places where they ride little else."
63,"TEXT_LUCKMA201_03282_SZEMDJENMAI_000_021","A chocobo? Do you hail from one of Norvrandt's more isolated settlements, perchance? I hear there are a few places where they ride little else."
64,"TEXT_LUCKMA201_03282_SZEMDJENMAI_000_022","But here in the Crystarium, mounts like that grey fellow there are far more commonly used."
65,"TEXT_LUCKMA201_03282_SZEMDJENMAI_000_023","...Hm. Seeing as you are plainly unaccustomed to riding amaro, I think it best I accompany you on this flight myself."
66,"TEXT_LUCKMA201_03282_SZEMDJENMAI_000_024","Any Zun worthy of the name could do it, of course, but the Exarch sent you to me. Ensuring you arrive safely is my responsibility."
67,"TEXT_LUCKMA201_03282_SZEMDJENMAI_000_025","Gather your things and meet me at the Amaro Launch. One of the junior tamers will attend to you while I ready the mounts."
68,"TEXT_LUCKMA201_03282_SZEMDJENMAI_000_030","Wait for me at the Amaro Launch. Just mention my name to the tamer on duty, and he will see you are taken care of."

76,"TEXT_LUCKMA201_03282_SZEMDJENMAI_000_060","We are arrived. This is Cracked Shell Beach, on the eastern coast of Kholusia. You should be safe here for the present."
77,"TEXT_LUCKMA201_03282_SZEMDJENMAI_000_061","Compared to the mainland, sin eater attacks are far less prevalent. And the native beasts are not any more dangerous than elsewhere."
78,"TEXT_LUCKMA201_03282_SZEMDJENMAI_000_062","It is the <Emphasis>people</Emphasis> you should be wary of..."
79,"TEXT_LUCKMA201_03282_SZEMDJENMAI_000_063","Spy you that city in the distance? That is Eulmore, the island's main settlement."
80,"TEXT_LUCKMA201_03282_SZEMDJENMAI_000_064","It rivals the Crystarium in scale, and was once an ally in our battle against the abominations."
81,"TEXT_LUCKMA201_03282_SZEMDJENMAI_000_065","For years, the Eulmoran elite have fancied themselves the masters of what remains of our broken world. They have gone as far as to offer the leaders of other settlements their protection─if we bend the knee."
82,"TEXT_LUCKMA201_03282_SZEMDJENMAI_000_066","But to say their ideals are questionable would be putting it mildly. The Crystarium is one among many who resist their heavy-handed authority, and while we are not at war, our relationship with Eulmore is strained at best."
83,"TEXT_LUCKMA201_03282_SZEMDJENMAI_000_067","It may be wise to conceal your ties with the Exarch during your stay here, especially in the vicinity of the city."
84,"TEXT_LUCKMA201_03282_SZEMDJENMAI_000_068","I am glad we understand each other.
Now, the Exarch has instructed me to divulge a secret that should make finding your friend a good deal easier. Listen closely..."
