1,"TEXT_LUCKBA341_03277_SEQ_01","In the days since your somewhat acrimonious parting, Lue-Reeq has come to visit Miss Olvara some few times. Though he seems to be in good health, he has yet to forge a new partnership with another Virtue-hunter, and so the elderly woman hopes that you can put aside whatever negative feelings you may harbor against the youth, and go to the Crystarium to see how he is faring."
2,"TEXT_LUCKBA341_03277_SEQ_02","Lue-Reeq is not at his usual table, nor does he appear to be anywhere in the general vicinity. Surely someone nearby will have noted his passing, though..."
3,"TEXT_LUCKBA341_03277_SEQ_03","In questioning the patrons of the Wandering Stairs you learn that Lue-Reeq's former partner, Lanbyrd, took his entourage to Rak'tika in order to slay Andreia. They were overmatched, however, and nearly slaughtered to a man, leaving a sole survivor of the battle to recount the tale to others at the Crystarium. Others then left to take up the hunt in their fallen comrades' stead, Lue-Reeq among them. Most likely he is still in the Greatwood─assuming he is still alive..."
4,"TEXT_LUCKBA341_03277_SEQ_04","Blessedly, you find the young lordling alive and well, and through the power of the Echo observe how he confronted Andreia, only to his horror discover that Lanbyrd and his fallen comrades had risen once more as eaters in service to the Virtue. Though Lue-Reeq is at first unsure how to reconcile this behavior with his knowledge of Renda-Rae's past, you explain that in truth she did not defeat Balam–Quitz alone, but rather with the aid of her fellow Warriors of Light. Finally recognizing his folly, the young lordling at last begs your forgiveness for his harsh words, and asks that you return with him to Gatetown to speak with Miss Olvara before you prepare for your final confrontation with Andreia."
5,"TEXT_LUCKBA341_03277_SEQ_05","A rather apologetic Lue-Reeq thanks both you and his former wet nurse for your constant support in spite of his myriad failings. Though he is far from certain how he might overcome his limitations and lay the spirit of Renda-Rae to rest, even with your assistance, he is willing to do whatever it takes to see his hunt through to the end.

※The next role quest will be available from Lue-Reeq upon reaching level 80 in any physical DPS class."
