0,"TEXT_LUCKBA201_03267_SEQ_00","A hearty-looking dwarf stands before you, draining a flagon of ale remarkably swiftly given the helmet."
1,"TEXT_LUCKBA201_03267_SEQ_01","After a brief exchange on the subject of dwarven manners and your own abilities, Giott solicits your assistance in hunting a particular sin eater. In the name of safety, however, you must first demonstrate your skill in the field to prove that you are up to the task."
2,"TEXT_LUCKBA201_03267_SEQ_02","You arrive at the Forest of the Lost Shepherd where, for reasons as yet profoundly unclear, Giott immediately antagonizes a local wolverine. Having made no effort in the name of defense, the dwarf is prone on the hard dirt path in the blink of an eye. As the ferocious beast shows no sign that this initial assault has sated it, it would be prudent to render assistance sooner rather than later."
3,"TEXT_LUCKBA201_03267_SEQ_03","You make short work of the wolverine, though Giott is still unable to stand. It appears that you will be giving a demonstration of field medicine in addition to offensive magic."
4,"TEXT_LUCKBA201_03267_SEQ_04","You swiftly tend to Giott's not inconsiderable injuries. Upon regaining verticality─if not dignity─the dwarf remarks in surprise and delight at your ability. Though this entire experience has raised rather many questions as to your would-be comrade's soundness of judgment, you nevertheless agree to meet again at the Crystarium."
5,"TEXT_LUCKBA201_03267_SEQ_05","After making your partnership official─and consuming quite a bit more ale─Giott at last divulges information on your target. The sin eater's name is Sophrosyne, though in life it was none other than Lamitt─the healer you once met during your confrontation with the Warriors of Darkness, and, according to your new friend, a shameful excuse for a dwarf. This assessment gives you much to ponder, which may be for the best, as Giott seems unwilling to begin actually hunting for the creature before imbibing yet more alcohol.

※The next role quest will be available from Giott upon reaching level 72 in any healer class."

93,"TEXT_LUCKBA201_03267_GIOTT_000_211","I suppose it's because Lamitt herself was some kind of master of the art, but Sophrosyne's healing is so powerful that no matter how hard I whack it, I can't leave a scratch."

99,"TEXT_LUCKBA201_03267_GIOTT_000_215","Listen, I know you have your own ways, and that's just fine. But whether you care much for dwarven honor or not, you have to agree that a sin eater that can raise its fellows from the grave is a danger to us all."
100,"TEXT_LUCKBA201_03267_GIOTT_000_216","As for Lamitt─you should know that being a dwarf is about respecting tradition, and she never did. Never."
101,"TEXT_LUCKBA201_03267_GIOTT_000_217","You might not have heard, but the tales say that Lamitt roamed the land─<Emphasis>without her helm.</Emphasis> She willingly showed her face to those who weren't kin! She knew full well that it would dishonor her and us all, and she did it anyway."
102,"TEXT_LUCKBA201_03267_GIOTT_000_218","Then there's the part about bringing doom on all the world─not one of our taboos, really, but it's generally frowned upon. And now she's back. Face bare to the world! A sin eater! What could make a dwarf go so wrong?"
103,"TEXT_LUCKBA201_03267_GIOTT_000_219","Ah, but we have ale to drink and sin eaters to hunt─in that order! You healed my body sure enough, but I'll need a few more flagons to restore my vigor. And by “a few,” I mean about a hundred. Come and find me later!"
