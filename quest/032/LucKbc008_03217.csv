It seems the lieutenant is currently on leave and taking his ease at the Carline Canopy...if you have a moment or two to spare."
2,"TEXT_LUCKBC008_03217_SEQ_02","You meet with Summoner Jajasamu, and the veteran mercenary speaks of his experience fighting alongside two young folk blessed with a resistance to primal influence. He seems bothered by the thought that their presence on the front line is less a choice than an imposed duty, and would have you ask their feelings on the issue. Arenvald, the more approachable of the pair, is to be found in Rhalgr's Reach."
3,"TEXT_LUCKBC008_03217_SEQ_03","You locate Arenvald with little trouble, and together you pay a visit to Fordola's cell in the city. The ensuing exchange reveals much about the young warriors and the motivations which drive them, but the ever-bitter Fordola soon bids you leave her be. Relenting to her wishes, you and Arenvald withdraw outside to the streets of the Ala Mhigan Quarter."

5,"TEXT_LUCKBC008_03217_SEQ_05","Upon hearing of Arenvald and Fordola's determination, Jajasamu himself resolves to provide the finest support he can muster─even if that means becoming the “second-best summoner in Eorzea.” He bids you send his regards to Y'mhitra before going on his way."
6,"TEXT_LUCKBC008_03217_SEQ_06","You return to Y'mhitra, and although she cannot claim you as a mentor, the scholar nevertheless seems inspired by the effect you have on your colleagues. To perfect the summoner's art and encourage the hearts of others─this is the proud burden you are fated to bear."
