He hands you a letter of introduction, and sends you to the Amaro Launch to find a man named Cassard."
2,"TEXT_LUCKMA301_03291_SEQ_02","After reading the Exarch's missive, the merchant seems more than happy to act as your guide. You have only to give the signal to begin your trek into the desert."

8,"TEXT_LUCKMA301_03291_SEQ_08","Upon arriving in Mord Souq, Cassard welcomes you with obvious enthusiasm, declaring his love for the place in the same breath. Judging by the grin on the merchant's face, your visit here promises to be an interesting one..."
