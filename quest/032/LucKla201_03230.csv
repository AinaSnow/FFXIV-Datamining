1,"TEXT_LUCKLA201_03230_SEQ_01","At the Crystalline Mean, you come upon an Allagan-esque node behaving erratically. Upon inspection, the machine mutters some curious words before hovering off. You decide to keep an eye on it lest it cause trouble for civilians."
2,"TEXT_LUCKLA201_03230_SEQ_02","After a brief pursuit, you find the node hassling a civilian who turns out to be its owner. With a well-placed slap, the woman fixes the node, which she affectionately calls Noddy, before introducing herself as Thiuna, a restorer of the Facet of Crafting and proprietor of Cherished Memories. Having explained that her focus is on items of sentimental value, Thiuna proposes a business arrangement. In order to hone her techniques, she asks you to supply the materials she needs, and you are happy to oblige. Thiuna then returns to her workshop at the Crystalline Mean and bids you join her when you are ready to begin."
3,"TEXT_LUCKLA201_03230_SEQ_03","At her workshop, which is for now simply borrowed space, Thiuna assigns you your first task─preparing the canvas repair material for a damaged painting. When the material is ready, Thiuna will use it to restore the artwork, and in so doing restore a vision of the lost village it depicts."
