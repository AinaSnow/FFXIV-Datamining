1,"TEXT_LUCKLA401_03236_SEQ_01","A brief moment with Qeshi-Rae gives you the impression that she is more interested in a creature known as the samiel than she is in her duties. No sooner does she set out to continue her search for the beast than a woman comes seeking her out. Breathless, she introduces herself as Yalana of the Hortorium and her quarry as Chief Qeshi-Rae of the Facet of Gathering, and entreats you to go and find the latter before she can venture outside the Crystarium."
2,"TEXT_LUCKLA401_03236_SEQ_02","You manage to catch Qeshi-Rae before she can fly off on an amaro. Crestfallen at having had her excursion thwarted, she turns her steps towards the Hortorium to face Yalana's displeasure, and you set off after her."
3,"TEXT_LUCKLA401_03236_SEQ_03","As a token of her thanks for finding Qeshi-Rae, Yalana tells you about the work of the Hortorium. She and her fellow researchers primarily conduct agricultural research to improve the Crystarium's ability to cultivate crops, and on the side analyze rare and unusual materials at the behest of the Facet of Gathering. With a gravity that seems at odds with her prior demeanor, Qeshi-Rae explains that the task of the facet isn't simply to gather; it also strives to identify and manage resources, that they might be conserved for posterity. When the discussion turns into a chastisement of Qeshi-Rae, the Mystel takes it as her cue to leave, and she flees to the Crystalline Mean, urging you to come with her."
4,"TEXT_LUCKLA401_03236_SEQ_04","Qeshi-Rae relates to you her quest to find the samiel, which she explains is an ancient and enormous beast of Mord legend. Convinced that you share her passion, she names you captain of the spontaneously formed Samiel Search Squad and bids you find and bring her evidence of the creature."
