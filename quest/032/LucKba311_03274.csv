1,"TEXT_LUCKBA311_03274_SEQ_01","The search for the Cardinal Virtue, Andreia, has begun, and Lue-Reeq's hirelings have already caught wind of news that may lead you to your prize more quickly than anticipated. Apparently, the fallen hunter was spotted in Amh Araeng, in the vicinity of Samiel's Backbone, and is said to be responsible for transforming a vicious spider into a rather more troublesome sin eater. Perhaps by pursuing this newborn you may ascertain the whereabouts of its creator..."
2,"TEXT_LUCKBA311_03274_SEQ_02","Upon arriving in Amh Araeng, Lue-Reeq declares that it would be most effective if you were to split up and search separately for the spider-turned-eater. With luck, this will not take terribly long."
3,"TEXT_LUCKBA311_03274_SEQ_03","A cursory search of your surroundings fails to turn up evidence of the spider's passing. However, there are still other parts of Amh Araeng where you may continue your hunt."
4,"TEXT_LUCKBA311_03274_SEQ_04","Sure enough, you eventually succeed in tracking down the spider and laying it low. Alas, there is still no sigh of Andreia. For now, all you can do is return to Samiel's Backbone and rendezvous with Lue-Reeq."
5,"TEXT_LUCKBA311_03274_SEQ_05","Before you can speak with your partner in crime, you catch sight of the Virtue, and find yourself suddenly walking in her memories. Long, long ago, she had come to Amh Araeng with two others in their search for a notorious mark known as Balam–Quitz. However, as they carried out their attack, the young Mystel was caught off guard by the beast's powerful roar, rendering her unable to come to the aid of her comrades, who were slain before her very eyes, for which she vowed to slay the fiend no matter what.

Although your sudden episode elicits Lue-Reeq's concern, you explain the nature of your gift and tell him of the memory you saw. Though the hunter is not entirely sure, he cannot shake the feeling that he has heard a similar tale before...but such discussions must wait until you have returned to the safety of the Crystarium."
6,"TEXT_LUCKBA311_03274_SEQ_06","Lue-Reeq toasts your victory over the newborn sin eater and bids you eat and drink your fill in celebration. Though his tastes seem rather extravagant, he assures you that he has ample coin to pay for it, and rewards you for your continued service with a pittance.

※The next role quest will be available from Lue-Reeq upon reaching level 74 in any physical DPS class."

51,"TEXT_LUCKBA311_03274_HIREDWOMAN03273_000_003","Greetings, milord. I am pleased to report that Andreia was recently sighted in Amh Araeng─in the vicinity of Samiel's Backbone, it would seem."
52,"TEXT_LUCKBA311_03274_HIREDWOMAN03273_000_004","Apparently, there was a right vicious spider what was giving folks trouble, and now that it's been turned, it's about a dozen times worse. They'd be grateful for any assistance."
53,"TEXT_LUCKBA311_03274_LUEREEQ_000_005","I see, I see! Well done, my friend. Your payment, as promised."
54,"TEXT_LUCKBA311_03274_LUEREEQ_000_006","Why bother going out and about pestering the smallfolk for news when you can employ others to do it for you? The better to devote our precious time to rather more important matters, I say!"
55,"TEXT_LUCKBA311_03274_LUEREEQ_000_007","And owing to my winning strategy, we may now depart for Amh Araeng and the delightfully named Samiel's Backbone─for in pursuing the spider, we may yet find its maker!"
56,"TEXT_LUCKBA311_03274_LUEREEQ_000_010","This is certainly the place. I gather those bones once belonged to dear Samiel...but I see no troublesome arachnid."
57,"TEXT_LUCKBA311_03274_LUEREEQ_000_011","It being a rather large desert, I had considered hiring a few trackers to hasten our search, but I have yet to spy a place where such individuals might congregate. Pity..."

59,"TEXT_LUCKBA311_03274_LUEREEQ_000_013","And should we <Emphasis>not</Emphasis> find it, well...after we both have searched for...a suitable length of time, I say we meet back here. Let the hunt begin!"

74,"TEXT_LUCKBA311_03274_LUEREEQ_000_060","Though...hmm. Two warriors killed while hunting a great horned beast─a beast their surviving companion vows to slay in revenge. I have heard this tale before, I know it..."
75,"TEXT_LUCKBA311_03274_LUEREEQ_000_061","Bah, it is a common enough sort of tale, I suppose. And regardless, she is gone. Come─let us return to the Crystarium and celebrate your accomplishment!"
