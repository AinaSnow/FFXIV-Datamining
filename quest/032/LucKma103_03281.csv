51,"TEXT_LUCKMA103_03281_MYSTERYVOICE_000_001","That is a conversation I would rather have in the privacy of my quarters, however. I must go on ahead to the tower and organize a few things, but I shall see that the guard knows to admit you."

58,"TEXT_LUCKMA103_03281_MYSTERYVOICE_000_008","An extraordinary tale. But I'm afraid I found no such individual residing in the tower when it passed into my care. Mayhap we can revisit that mystery another time. For now, I think it best that we focus on the present."

67,"TEXT_LUCKMA103_03281_MYSTERYVOICE_000_051","When you are ready to retire, the manager will show you to your lodgings. Pray rest and recuperate, and we shall reconvene in the Ocular anon."
