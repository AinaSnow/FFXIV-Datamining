51,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_LOBB_000_002","She's been having frequent dizzy spells, much like I was. But if that weren't bad enough, there's something wrong with her eyes. The whites have gone all yellow!"
52,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_FRITHRIK_000_003","Yes, as far as I can tell, the dizziness is due to a certain “thinness” of the blood, while the discoloration is a sign of jaundice."
53,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_LOBB_000_004","She's been like this for a long time, and she's understandably reluctant to go outside, which isn't doing her much good, either. Is there something we can do for the lass?"
54,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_FRITHRIK_000_005","Well, those ancient tomes might have something to say on the matter. Lobb, follow me!"

56,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_LOBB_000_009","Without your help, I don't think I would ever have recovered. If there's anything you need from me, just say the word."

62,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_MERVYL_000_019","And as for you, Lobb, I thought you'd have more sense than to throw in your lot with these two."
63,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_LOBB_000_020","Mervyl, for once in your life, would you shut up and listen? They're the reason why I'm up and walking again. Don't you see? Frithrik was right!"
64,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_MERVYL_000_021","Is that so? Be that as it may, we should leave healing the sick to the professionals!"

68,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_LOBB_000_025","That's why Mervyl and the rest of the old guard are not like to agree with anything that might lead to fewer fish being caught. The younger ones will be more likely to support your cause, though."
69,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_LOBB_000_026","To be honest, I can't see your talk of balanced diets winning their support. But there must be a way to get through to them..."
70,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_FRITHRIK_000_027","I'm sure there will be time to think about that once I've found a treatment for your friend."
71,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_LOBB_000_028","I appreciate what you're doing for her, but why don't we have the curators look for the information instead?"
72,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_LOBB_000_029","In the meantime, we can concentrate on getting some of the other fishers on your side."
73,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_FRITHRIK_000_030","Hmm... I tried that before, but they weren't interested in any of my ideas."
74,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_LOBB_000_031","Can you blame them? They're not culinarians or chirurgeons, they're fishers. I think they'd be a lot easier to persuade if you can prove you're worthy of being their leader."
75,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_LOBB_000_032","Perhaps you could try catching something they've never seen before, like a calico trout. That'd impress them."
76,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_FRITHRIK_000_033","Yes, that might work! Now all we need to do is locate and catch one of the most elusive fish in the history of our art. Hmm... It's no easy feat, that much is certain."
77,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_FRITHRIK_000_034","And to make matters worse, the last known sighting of a calico trout was in Il Mheg, which until now, I have gone to great lengths to avoid."

79,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_FRITHRIK_000_035","Since you seem to be on good terms with at least one pixie, they may decide to leave us alone long enough for us to hook our prey."
80,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_LOBB_000_036","Pixies!? Rather you than me! Anyway, once I've asked the curators to lend us a hand with these books, I'll keep an eye on things at the Mean. Someone's got to take care of the place while you're away!"
81,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_LOBB_000_037","Frithrik is already at the waters by the House of the First Light. You'd better catch up before he gets himself into trouble."
82,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_FRITHRIK_000_040","This place is a lot more pleasant than I was expecting, and I haven't been accosted by even one pixie thus far!"
83,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_FRITHRIK_000_041","You don't think they'd play any mean tricks on us, do you?"
84,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_FRITHRIK_000_042","If it's all the same to you, I'd like to catch that fish as soon as possible and get back to the Crystarium."
85,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_FRITHRIK_000_043","We might even be able to get this done more quickly if we make it into a friendly competition. The first one to deliver a calico trout to Lobb is the winner!"
86,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_FRITHRIK_000_045","I'll admit, I can't escape the feeling we're being watched. Is it still paranoia if you're right?"
87,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_FRITHRIK_000_050","Wh-What!? You've already caught one? I thought I'd offer a bit more resistance in our little contest, but I'll be joining you back in the Mean after I've caught one for myself."
88,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_FRITHRIK_000_051","I have a feeling I'll get a bite any moment now!"
89,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_LOBB_000_055","So, how did it go?"
90,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_LOBB_000_056","As I live and breathe! It's...magnificent."
91,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_FRITHRIK_000_057","Lobb! I caught one too!"
92,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_LOBB_000_058","Of course, I'd expect nothing less from the head of the Facet of Fishing!"
93,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_LOBB_000_059","Anyone who doubted you will be put firmly in their place when they see what you've caught."
94,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_FRITHRIK_000_060","I hope you're right. If all goes according to plan, we'll be able to get a few of the younger members to go after the rarer species in your stead."
95,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_LOBB_000_062","Yes, and that'll give me more time to help here with giving assignments and seeing to deliveries, which in turn will make it easier for you to show your face down at the Source a bit more often."
96,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_LOBB_000_063","Mervyl and his cronies will find it a lot harder to ignore you that way. Once they see you're taking care of the day-to-day running of the Facet of Fishing, they're more likely to lend you an ear, and maybe even a hand."
97,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_LOBB_000_064","But before all that, there's a certain young lady in need of help. Maybe the curators have dug up the information we were after?"
98,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_FRITHRIK_000_065","Goodness me! I have to admit that had all but slipped my mind! I'm lucky I have you here to remind me."
99,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_FRITHRIK_000_066","I'll go ahead to the Cabinet of Curiosity, but we'll send word if there is anything that requires your assistance. I shall see you anon!"
100,"TEXT_LUCKLA502_03240_SYSTEM_000_067","The next request will be available from Frithrik upon reaching level 78 as a fisher."
