But if you're reading <Emphasis>this</Emphasis>, then you know how the story goes, don't you? So now comes the choice: hold the crystal close that we may enjoy these moments together. Or put it away and pretend I was never a part of it. That I was never really here."

Feels like a lifetime ago, come to think on it. You've been through quite a lot since then─accomplished incredible things. I'd like to think that, in some way, I was a part of your journey... Far from the best, no doubt. But for me and my own journey, I think it safe to say that you've been...well. There's no suitable words to describe it, really.
I've done things. Made decisions. Looking back, I can't help but feel more than a little foolish. But such is life, and we have to seize what few opportunities we have for closure...even if it is through the written word and not face–to–face.
So wherever you are, I hope you're happy. Still fighting, still adventuring─still doing what you love. Be well.“

It would seem a visit to the Congregation is in order.<If(Equal(PlayerParameter(68),32))>
