1,"TEXT_LUCKBC015_03224_SEQ_01","Arya greets you with even more enthusiasm than usual. According to a letter she recently received, your former mentor has need of your help. Though the missive is light on details, it seems X'rhun would have you join him in the Ala Mhigan Quarter."
2,"TEXT_LUCKBC015_03224_SEQ_02","Upon meeting with X'rhun, you learn that a band of graverobbers has made off with a blade once belonging to a member of the Crimson Duelists. The thieves have proven difficult to apprehend by nonlethal measures, and he could use an extra pair of hands (or two, thanks to the stubborn Arya) to ensure he has a captive to interrogate. With the situation explained, X'rhun directs you to a rendezvous point on the eastern edge of Bloodhowe."
3,"TEXT_LUCKBC015_03224_SEQ_03","X'rhun assigns you the role of convincing the graverobbers to walk into a prepared ambush. Venture into Bloodhowe, and locate the thieves in question."
4,"TEXT_LUCKBC015_03224_SEQ_04","You find the graverobbers, and manage to persuade them to move towards the east side of Bloodhowe. They do, however, take your advice with one caveat: you are to go along with them. Catch up to the unsavory band where they await you up ahead."
5,"TEXT_LUCKBC015_03224_SEQ_05","With an eye towards “eliminating the competition,” two members of the graverobbing gang remained behind to waylay you─rather unsuccessfully, as it turns out. Continue on to X'rhun Tia's location, and find out how well your own companions' ambush proceeded."
6,"TEXT_LUCKBC015_03224_SEQ_06","You return to find the remaining thieves trussed up and interrogated. If the captives' confession is to be believed, you will find their stash of ill-gotten gains buried somewhere within the expanse of the Royal Hunting Grounds."
7,"TEXT_LUCKBC015_03224_SEQ_07","A soft patch of ground betrays the location of the graverobbers' buried stash. You soon unearth a large box, and confirm that it contains the missing sword, as well as a collection of other plundered mementos. Join the relieved X'rhun in returning the stolen relics to the Tomb of the Errant Sword."
8,"TEXT_LUCKBC015_03224_SEQ_08","With the keepsakes of the departed back in their rightful place, X'rhun tells the story of his deceased comrade and his custom-made blade. The sword must have a new owner, and, following through on his promise to continue her tutelage, X'rhun offers Arya the hilt. Caught up in the moment, the three of you reaffirm your dedication to the creed of the red."
9,"TEXT_LUCKBC015_03224_SEQ_09","With apologies to Arya and her education, X'rhun states his intention to resume his pilgrimage across Eorzea that he might be in place to battle the incursions of the Empire. He will, however, return to Mor Dhona from time to time to look in on his student. Arya accepts this decision with good grace, and urges you to join her back in Revenant's Toll."
10,"TEXT_LUCKBC015_03224_SEQ_10","Now that she has regained a measure of her mastery over red magic, Arya aspires to perfect the use of her newly acquired weapon. It is time you returned to your own adventures, lest you fail to meet the lofty expectations of your fellow mages!"
