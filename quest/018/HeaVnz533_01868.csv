0,"TEXT_HEAVNZ533_01868_SEQ_00","Mogkul is worried about the invading dragons' intentions."
1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ533_01868_SEQ_01","Mogkul is confused as to why dragons would be attacking them if their true intention was to destroy Zenith. Mogleo, having just recently joined the Pomguard, asks Mogkul why the dragons are loath to let the holy place stand. Mogkul explains that Zenith stands as a symbol of the once-strong friendship between the landlords and the skylords, and is all that remains standing after Nidhogg's wrath laid waste to the land. Mogleo surmises that the dragons are not aiming to destroy the whole tower, but the object that most symbolizes it: the spire. Mogkul and the others rush off towards the spire, and Mogkul commands Mogleo to stay put due to his wounds. Mogleo asks you to aid the Pomguard in defense of Zenith."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ533_01868_SEQ_02","It seems Mogleo was correct, and upon arriving at the spire of Zenith you see the injured members of the Pomguard with a fearsome dragon flapping its wings menacingly above them. While the dragon is impressed that the moogles were able to survive thus far, it has no intention of letting anyone escape this time. It attacks, but you slay it as you have many dragons before it. Check on the grounded members of the Pomguard to ensure that their wounds are not severe."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ533_01868_SEQ_03","The moogles seem to recover from their battle relatively quickly, and are filled with pride that Zenith still stands unharmed. The moogles say that they will continue to honor their sacred covenant with Hraesvelgr, but express regret that they lack the means to do anything more than patrol the palace and clean up the occasional minor mess. However, the moogles are proud of their accomplishment this day, and Mogkul states they will perform one final patrol of Zenith to ensure that there are no more dragons wandering about. Return to Moghome and tell Captain Mogloo about his troops' heroic deeds."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ533_01868_SEQ_04","Mogloo is grateful that you were able to assist the Pomguard in protecting Zenith, and proud that they were able to save it from disaster. Echoing Mogkul's sentiment, Mogloo wishes that the moogles could do something to repair the damage Zenith suffers as the years pass. However, until the day arrives when the moogles learn the required skills, they will dutifully continue their patrol and cleaning duties."
