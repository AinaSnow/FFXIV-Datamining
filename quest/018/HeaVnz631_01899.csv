1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ631_01899_SEQ_01","Your presence recalls Gildon from his fretful pondering, and also brings to mind a request for assistance. The paissas found north of Camp Cloudtop, known for their mischief and antics, have struck a nerve with Gildon by spoiling the cuisine of their resident Rose Knight cook. He asks that you slay three of the paissas to both thin their numbers and make clear the men of Camp Cloudtop will not tolerate their devilment."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ631_01899_SEQ_02","You slay three paissas to the north of Camp Cloudtop. Return to Gildon and let him know the deed is done."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ631_01899_SEQ_03","Gildon thanks you for your hard work. He tells you the cause for their recent roguery is their search for trees to build a nest. Camp Cloudtop has an adequate number of trees to suit the needs of Gildon and his comrades, and thanks to your help, the paissas will think twice before trying to take them as their own."
