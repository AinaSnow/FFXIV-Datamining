1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ324_01816_SEQ_01","Kal Myhk tells you his brother has been seriously injured. In the hopes of promoting a swift recovery, he wishes to keep his brother well fed. To that end, he asks that you help him hunt for food. Meet with Kal Myhk down at the river and be ready to hunt."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ324_01816_SEQ_02","Kal Myhk plans to bring his brother both jagil and loaghtan meat, and needs your help. The loaghtans are known to graze up north, but he is forbidden from traveling so far upstream. He asks that you hunt one in his stead."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ324_01816_SEQ_03","You slay a loaghtan and obtain its meat. Return south with your bounty and report your success to Kal Myhk."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ324_01816_SEQ_04","Kal Myhk is quite pleased with your kill. With meat and fish in hand, he insists on going straight to his brother in Mourn."
5,"TEXT_HEAVNZ324_01816_SEQ_05","You arrive at Mourn and find Kal Myhk but a few steps inside. Next to him is his brother, lying motionless on the floor. Kal Myhk rouses him and offers him the fish and meat you procured. His brother refuses, and becoming aware of your presence, grows increasingly angry at the offering. He recalls the men who plucked him from the skies of Coerthas, nearly claiming his life. He warns Kal Myhk that no man can be trusted, and claims that you too will soon turn to betray him. Kal Myhk is at a loss for words, and quickly leaves the cave to consider his brother's words. Seek Kal Myhk near Anyx Trine, and see how he is handling this news."
6,"TEXT_HEAVNZ324_01816_SEQ_06","You find Kal Myhk on the steps of Anyx Trine, a sullen look on his face. While he appreciates all you have done for him, it seems he would choose to heed his brother's warning."
