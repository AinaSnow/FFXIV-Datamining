However, moogles are not the only thing proving to be a nuisance. He asks you to slay three of the dragons in the area so that he might have the peace he desires."

4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ607_01875_SEQ_04","Mogoon is pleased that he can finally show his reverence to the Mother of the Sheave in silence. The statue is made in the image of Shiva when she fell in love with the great wyrm Hraesvelgr, so it should be treated with the utmost respect."
