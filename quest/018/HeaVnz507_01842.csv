3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ507_01842_SEQ_03","Mognell is relieved to hear of the damselflies' deaths. He tells you how the appearance of invasive vilekin is a common occurrence in the Churning Mists, their eggs brought back from the world below in the soil stuck between the claws of returning dragons. The next time such a species appears, Mognell will deal with it himself...provided he can't convince a passing adventurer to do his job for him."
