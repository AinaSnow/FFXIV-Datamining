1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ503_01838_SEQ_01","The malcontent moogle informs you that while moca leaf has its uses, it will not allay his friend's fever on its own. To complete the medicine, he must add a handful or three of blistering scales, freshly sliced from the skin of a Mists biast. The malcontent moogle hands you a Moglinglaive to strip the scales from the lizards' tails, and sends you on your way."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ503_01838_SEQ_02","You successfully relieve the local Mists biasts of their scales. Deliver them to the malcontent moogle of Moghome, so that he might prepare the medicine to cure his febrile friend."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ503_01838_SEQ_03","The malcontent moogle is reasonably satisfied with your haul of scales, and immediately sets about brewing the medicine that will calm his friend's fever. The meandering moogle of Moghome shall surely soon be back on his feet and ready to resume his wanderings."
