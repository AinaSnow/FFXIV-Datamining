1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ618_01886_SEQ_01","Redwald has requested your help in part of Falcon's Nest's ongoing investigations into the heretics' actions. He asks you to travel to the ruins of Hemlock. The knight stationed there will advise you what to do from there."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ618_01886_SEQ_02","There have been reports that there are heretics hiding within the ruins supposedly with a mind to establish a base of operations. There should be four heretics there. Find them and eliminate them."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ618_01886_SEQ_03","You have found and killed all four heretics reported as taking refuge within Hemlock. Report back to Redwald that this insidious threat has been dealt with."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ618_01886_SEQ_04","Redwald thanks you for your work, but goes on to explain that not all heretics truly believe in the Dravanian Horde's doctrine. Many are simply criminals who have nowhere else to run. Of course, their lack of conviction does not make them any less traitorous in the eyes of Ishgardian law."
