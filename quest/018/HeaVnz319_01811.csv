1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ319_01811_SEQ_01","Although hesitant at first, the indomitable wyvern admits to the cause for his distress: his younger brother has gone missing. He cannot say for certain, but he believes his sibling may be lost somewhere in Mourn. Search the cavern of Mourn for the missing dragon youngling."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ319_01811_SEQ_02","You find the dragon youngling safe and sound, rousing from sleep. His mind still fuzzy from slumber, he regards you with indifference bordering on distaste. One mention of his brother, however, quickly sends him flying toward the exit. Head back to the indomitable wyvern and see if his younger brother has returned safely."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ319_01811_SEQ_03","You exit the cave to find the indomitable wyvern in the company of his younger brother. He thanks you and looks down to his little brother, hoping the young dragon will also pay respects. You are offered only silence as he flies off without saying a word. The indomitable wyvern quickly apologizes, promising his brother will be dealt with in short order."
