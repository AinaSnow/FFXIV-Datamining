Just as he had feared, the Gnath's mental link to the Overmind had been reestablished and the poor creature is once again a drone of the Onemind. The astute Vath seems to harbor a gnawing fear that the same could one day happen to him, stripping him of all individuality and rendering him another mindless slave of the Overmind."
