He asks you to speak with the man and convince him to leave that hazardous place. Persuade Emont to go to Falcon's Nest and live with his nephew."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ619_01887_SEQ_02","Emont explains that Oakum Landing is his home, and that he has no intention of leaving. He suggests that if you are truly concerned that the area is dangerous, you should help by killing off some of the tursuses that wander near the landing."

4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ619_01887_SEQ_04","Emont is grateful to you for making the area safer, but still has not the slightest intention of leaving. The man seems resolute. Relay his message back to his nephew waiting at Falcon's Nest."
5,"TEXT_HEAVNZ619_01887_SEQ_05","The Elezen is disappointed that his uncle is being so stubborn, but he appreciates your efforts, both in attempting to persuade the man and in making the area safer. He yet holds out hope that, with time, the old man might change his mind."
