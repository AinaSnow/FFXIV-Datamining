4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ623_01891_SEQ_04","Ayleth takes the fang and leaves for the Convictory. Return there yourself and inform Margyt that Ayleth is unharmed."
5,"TEXT_HEAVNZ623_01891_SEQ_05","Margyt is glad that Ayleth is safe. She explains that the girl's drive to bring about change in Ishgard stems from the murder of her lover by an Ishgardian nobleman. Many lowborn seem to share her sentiments, but are afraid to speak out for fear of being branded heretics."
