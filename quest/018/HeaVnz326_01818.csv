1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ326_01818_SEQ_01","Gullinkambi reminds you that dragons are wont to let nature take its course when healing, but she has no objections to using knowledge of the tablet to help Ohl Ahs. She asks that you take Kal Myhk with you as you prepare the medicine described on the tablet."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ326_01818_SEQ_02","Kal Myhk asks you what ingredients are required for the medicine, and after examining the faded tome, you find the recipe calls for wyvern tails. He tells you they can be found northeast of Anyx Trine. Journey to the Iron Feast and locate the items."

4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ326_01818_SEQ_04","Examining the tablet further, you discern the next step is an infusion of the wyvern tails, which extracts their healing properties with boiling water. Travel to Camp Tailfeather and seek out tools for the infusion."
5,"TEXT_HEAVNZ326_01818_SEQ_05","You search Camp Tailfeather and the surrounding area and come across a small camp with a pot over a roaring fire. After speaking with the camp's residents, they agree to let you use the pot and produce a wyvern tail infusion. Return to Anyx Trine and show Kal Myhk the fruits of your labor."

7,"TEXT_HEAVNZ326_01818_SEQ_07","You find Kal Myhk just beyond the mouth of Mourn and his brother is fast asleep. Apply the wyvern tail infusion to his wounds, but try not to wake him."
8,"TEXT_HEAVNZ326_01818_SEQ_08","You carefully apply the infusion, but upon closer inspection find broken spear tips still lodged in his wounds. Their removal awakens Ohl Ahs who is displeased to see his sleep disturbed, more so by the fact that it was your doing. However, his anger is soon abated as he realizes the pain that gripped him for so long is finally gone. Kal Myhk explains that it was you who labored to treat his injuries, and helps him understand that not all people are wicked. Return to Anyx Trine, and inform Gullinkambi that the treatment was a success."
9,"TEXT_HEAVNZ326_01818_SEQ_09","You arrive at Anyx Trine, and Gullinkambi can tell by your look of satisfaction that Ohl Ahs has recovered from his injuries.
