1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ528_01863_SEQ_01","Mogloo, Captain of the Pomguard, has asked you to aid in the defense of Zenith against the encroaching minions of the dread wyrm Nidhogg, which have become more bold since the dragon's awakening. Mogloo bids you speak with Mogkul, his second-in-command, at Asah for further details of your duty."

However, the increasing rashness of Nidhogg's brood has made it even more difficult to do their duty, and Mogkul is overjoyed when you agree to help them. Begin your valiant defense of Zenith with the other moogles at your side."
