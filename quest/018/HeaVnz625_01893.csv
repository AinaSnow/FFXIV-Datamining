1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ625_01893_SEQ_01","With no idea where to look next for Ayleth, Margyt suggests talking to the troops at the Convictory to see if anyone might know where she could be. Ask around and see what you can find out."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ625_01893_SEQ_02","Ayleth was spotted at the <Emphasis>North Star</Emphasis> by one of the scouts on patrol. Travel there and find her."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ625_01893_SEQ_03","An unknown nobleman offered Ayleth power and status in exchange for the dragon tooth, but it was a trick. He stole the tooth and left Ayleth with nothing. Margyt assures her that despite not having status or social power, if they work together, they can bring about change in the Ishgardian society. Ayleth agrees to work together with Margyt to this end. Margyt asks you to talk to her back at the Convictory so she can continue the discussion in the safety of the camp."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNZ625_01893_SEQ_04","Though no one soldier at the Convictory holds great power, Margyt explains that, like any cohesive fighting unit, if she and Ayleth combine their strength and work together, they can achieve much more than they ever could alone. With this in mind, they resolve to change Ishgard for the better."

66,"TEXT_HEAVNZ625_01893_MARGYT_000_045","But he explained to me that change doesn't have to come from the top. Even from the bottom of society, we can bring about change. Even with what little power we have, if we work together, we can make a difference."
67,"TEXT_HEAVNZ625_01893_MARGYT_000_046","Please, Ayleth, will you fight with me? Help me change Ishgard. We may not be noble, shining dragoons, but we can do it."

76,"TEXT_HEAVNZ625_01893_MARGYT_100_064","But while we were searching for Ayleth, Dominiac said something to me that made me reconsider."
77,"TEXT_HEAVNZ625_01893_MARGYT_000_065","He explained that any fighting force is made of frontline fighters and the troops behind that support them. The front lines can never feel safe if they can't rely on their support to be there when needed. That's why he puts his strongest, most reliable troops in support positions."
78,"TEXT_HEAVNZ625_01893_MARGYT_000_066","He's no fool. He has carefully considered where each soldier can do the most good. Once I realized this, I realized that there's no shame in supporting my unit."
79,"TEXT_HEAVNZ625_01893_MARGYT_000_068","Just as warriors can make a difference from either the front or the rear of the battle, so too can we change Ishgard from either the top of society or the very bottom. I truly believe this, and want to fight together with Ayleth to achieve it."
