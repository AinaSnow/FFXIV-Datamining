Despite the bond you have formed with him, he now wonders if you would have slain him had you met under different circumstances. Do what you can to /soothe him and cast aside his fearful thoughts."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ325_01817_SEQ_02","While Kal Myhk accepts the reality of his brother's near-fatal encounter, you have helped him understand that not all men are evil. No longer distracted by burdens of fear and doubt, he asks for your help in finding a way to heal his brother. He suggests speaking with his mother, Gullinkambi, in the tower of Anyx Trine."

Ohl Ahs was warned not to venture near Ishgard, and he will either recover from sleep or remain forever in the halls of Mourn. However, she recalls a man who once labored to create medicine capable of healing dragons. If you are intent on healing Ohl Ahs with the medicines of man, she bids you find his research. She believes they may be in the remnants of his home somewhere in the Sohm Al foothills. Speak with Kal Myhk and discuss your next course of action."
