Go to Eil Tohm and slay the inconsiderate hropken, then fill the empty ewer Mogret gave you with water for the flowers."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ502_01837_SEQ_02","The hropken will no longer be a problem for the moogles of Moghome, and the once-empty ewer is now filled with sparkling spring water. Bring it to Mogret before her flowers wilt away into nothing."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ502_01837_SEQ_03","Mogret is ecstatic that her flowers will be able to bloom even further. It seems the increase in dragons is a recent phenomena, and Mogret seems convinced that they have only come to give the moogles a hard time."
