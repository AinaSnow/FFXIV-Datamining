His nerves frayed by the constant vigilance required of his position, he begs your assistance to delay the wyverns' plans. Drop down to the Four Arms and slay four elder wyverns, buying Mogeuge some time to rest his weary mind."

The moogle has been in constant fear of the dragons ever since Nidhogg's roar drove them into a frenzy. However, your kind assistance has bought the fraught moogle a few hours of rest and relaxation."
