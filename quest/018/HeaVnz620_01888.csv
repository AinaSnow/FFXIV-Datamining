1,"TEXT_HEAVNZ620_01888_SEQ_01","Emont is trying to make something, but he is concerned by the constant harassment by the sleet traps around his home. He would hate for them to destroy something he has worked hard to make. Slay five of these beasts to help put the man's mind at ease."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNZ620_01888_SEQ_02","You rid the area of five beastly sleet traps. Let Emont know that he need no longer live in fear of these ghastly vandals and their destructive behavior."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNZ620_01888_SEQ_03","Emont offers his thanks and explains what he was working on. Before the Calamity froze the waters, Oakum Landing was frequented by countless ships. In those days, Emont would recycle unneeded or damaged rigging and sell it for other ships to use for repairs or reinforcements. Though the ice and cold have stopped the ships from reaching him, he plans to prepare for the day the rivers melt by having plenty of rigging prepared for sale."

52,"TEXT_HEAVNZ620_01888_EMONT_000_021","Long ago, I used to recycle rigging and sell it to the ships that passed by here. It may not look it now, but this place was once a bustling hub of activity."
