They then mention that the little girl whose nightmare you vanquished is currently dreaming, and you are invited to join them for a meeting inside Lyhe Mheg.

※You may enter Lyhe Mheg by speaking with Thon Sul in Lydha Lran.

3,"TEXT_BANPIX002_03684_SEQ_03","With things settled in Lakeland, you turn your attention to those suffering nightmares in another region─Kholusia. Your mission is to track down the individual in whom An Lad has planted a nightmare, but it appears the pale pixie has employed magicks to veil the scent. At Ezel's suggestion, you make your way to Pla Enni in order to seek the counsel of its creator."
4,"TEXT_BANPIX002_03684_SEQ_04","You speak with Ezel's creator, the Nu Mou Lugg Aenc, who provides you with valuable insights. Based on their explanation of how an unusual pixie such as An Lad might be born, you deduce that the source of the nightmares is most likely a child who is tormented by hunger. Thus do you set out for the village of Wright, where the stench of nightmares is concentrated."
5,"TEXT_BANPIX002_03684_SEQ_05","Upon arriving in Wright, you are approached by a local woman, who says her foster son is suffering from recurring nightmares. She goes on to explain that the boy refuses to eat unless he is ripe to collapse, out of fear that the food will run out. Believing this to be a promising lead, Ezel suggests looking for the child."
6,"TEXT_BANPIX002_03684_SEQ_06","After a brief search, you find the boy tossing and turning in his sleep. The conspicuous lack of a scent marks him as the source of the nightmares in Kholusia, and Ezel wastes no time setting to work. Having devoured the nightmare, the familiar rushes off to find a safe place to deposit it, and you hurry close on, ready to spring into action."
7,"TEXT_BANPIX002_03684_SEQ_07","Using their magicks, Tyr Beq transforms the nightmare into a corporeal being, which you summarily strike down. As you put away your weapon, you notice that the pixie is looking a little queasy..."

9,"TEXT_BANPIX002_03684_SEQ_09","Soon after waking up, the boy asks his foster mother for food─a positive sign that he has overcome his torment. No sooner do they leave than An Lad appears before you once more. Vexed by your ongoing interference, the pixie speaks cryptic words before taking their leave. Setting the encounter aside in your mind for now, you turn your steps back to Lyhe Mheg, where another gate awaits opening."
10,"TEXT_BANPIX002_03684_SEQ_10","You arrive in Lyhe Mheg to find your companions waiting for you. Without preamble, Tyr Beq asks you do the honors and open the next gate─that which leads to Kholusia."

And as you and Ezel watch in marvel, the pixie draws upon the amassed bubbles to create a fantastical house of treats along with an array of play equipment. Such, it seems, is the magic of Lyhe Mheg."
12,"TEXT_BANPIX002_03684_SEQ_12","Pride writ plain on their face, Tyr Beq bids you play as long as you like in the realm before heading outside to await you in Lydha Lran."
