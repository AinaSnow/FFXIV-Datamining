1,"TEXT_LUCKME101_03630_SEQ_01","Greeting you with his customary cheer, the master of suites informs you that the Crystal Exarch has requested your presence in the Ocular."
2,"TEXT_LUCKME101_03630_SEQ_02","Having taken your place amongst your comrades in the Ocular, you discuss the mission to find and vanquish the Lightwarden of Kholusia. Yet even as you allow yourselves a moment to consider the prospect of victory, Emet-Selch sours the mood with the declaration that driving back the Light will not serve to save the world. Elaborating upon his earlier history lesson, he informs you that as Zodiark and Hydaelyn warred, the latter struck a devastating blow which sundered not only Her foe, but all of creation, into fourteen fragments. It was then, looking upon the shattered remains of their home, that the Ascians resolved to rejoin the worlds. While Emet-Selch's tale only serves to underscore the difference between your goals, you have little choice but to focus on the mission at hand. According to intelligence, the forces of Eulmore are entrenching themselves inside the city, suggesting that the Lightwarden likely hides therein. So it is that you and your comrades depart for Kholusia, having agreed to rendezvous in the village of Wright."

4,"TEXT_LUCKME101_03630_SEQ_04","On the way to Gatetown, you encounter civilians behaving strangely, as if in a trance, with some proving hostile. While their behavior is unsettling, for now the way is secure, and you press on to the settlement as planned."
5,"TEXT_LUCKME101_03630_SEQ_05","You arrive in Gatetown to find it gripped by a strange phenomenon. It seems the villagers you encountered en route were far from the only ones affected..."
