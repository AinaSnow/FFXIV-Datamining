52,"TEXT_BANPIX105_03693_UINNEE_000_004","Hmph! As penance, I demand that you go forth and fetch the echevore tail that I seek! And if you see any Fuath along the way, feel free to smack them in their smarmy faces with those stupid little hats of theirs!"
53,"TEXT_BANPIX105_03693_UINNEE_000_010","<sniff> Is that sweet, sweet honey I smell? I knew you wouldn't come back empty-handed! Well, hand it over then, already!"

55,"TEXT_BANPIX105_03693_UINNEE_000_012","Ahem! Which is to say, of <Emphasis>course</Emphasis> I'm not thinking of taking a sip! We pixies have <Emphasis>far</Emphasis> more refined palates than those silly Nu Mou. We're not ones to sit around all day sucking on these icky tails!"
