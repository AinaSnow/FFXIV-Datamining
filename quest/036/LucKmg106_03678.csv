49,"TEXT_LUCKMG106_03678_KAISHIRR_000_001","The Chais are part of it, I s'pose. They've been good to me. I only wish there was something more I could do to help them..."
50,"TEXT_LUCKMG106_03678_ALPHINAUD_000_020","It makes no sense for Master Chai to have left without a word. But even if he had, he would not have done so unobserved."
51,"TEXT_LUCKMG106_03678_ALPHINAUD_000_021","<Emphasis>Someone</Emphasis> here will have seen something. I am sure of it."
52,"TEXT_LUCKMG106_03678_ALPHINAUD_000_022","We should split up and inquire as to whether anyone saw him leave or, failing that, if they have any idea where he might have gone. I will meet you at the Glory Gate to compare notes later on."
53,"TEXT_LUCKMG106_03678_ALPHINAUD_000_040","It would seem Master Chai paid a visit to the Beehive before taking his leave of Eulmore. Unfortunately, the patrons I spoke with were too deep in their cups to remember aught else."
54,"TEXT_LUCKMG106_03678_KAISHIRR_000_045","...You ever get the feeling you're being watched? Ahh, I'm probably just imagining things."
55,"TEXT_LUCKMG106_03678_SYSTEM_000_048","You find a shoebill gazing in Kai-Shirr's general direction. Silent. Vigilant. Plotting...?"
56,"TEXT_LUCKMG106_03678_MOWEN_000_060","Master Chai? Why yes, I spoke with him recently, though I recall he was in a rather dour mood. Concerned about Eulmore's neglect of industry, you see."
57,"TEXT_LUCKMG106_03678_MOWEN_000_061","With Lord Vauthry's apparently inexhaustible stores of meol, and no great need for money, it's little wonder our businesses were all but forgotten under his rule."
58,"TEXT_LUCKMG106_03678_MOWEN_000_062","But I assured Master Chai that the Boutique of Splendors will do all it can to contribute to the revival of trade here in Eulmore─which seemed to satisfy him. He took his leave soon after."
59,"TEXT_LUCKMG106_03678_SYSTEM_000_063","Your exchange with Mowen has taught you about “The stagnant state of business in Eulmore.”"
60,"TEXT_LUCKMG106_03678_CORNENNE_000_070","Looking for Master Chai, are you? Is something amiss? When last I saw him, he seemed ready to collapse from exhaustion. I insisted he rest and catch his breath, and we talked for a while─about his concerns over the city's defenses amongst other things."
61,"TEXT_LUCKMG106_03678_CORNENNE_000_071","He made more than a few valid points. Many of our men are still recovering after your confrontation with Lord Vauthry, and finding General Ran'jit in a heap in the middle of the plaza shook us all to the core."
62,"TEXT_LUCKMG106_03678_CORNENNE_100_071","The man commanded no small amount of loyalty, and some of our longest-serving soldiers seemed lost without him. Indeed, a number of them left."
63,"TEXT_LUCKMG106_03678_CORNENNE_000_072","N-Not that we blame <Emphasis>you</Emphasis>, of course. Without you and yours, we would still be blind to the error of our ways."
64,"TEXT_LUCKMG106_03678_CORNENNE_000_073","Anyway...funding permitting, I proposed replenishing our ranks with volunteers from the Derelicts and Gatetown."
65,"TEXT_LUCKMG106_03678_CORNENNE_000_074","We have a duty to protect not only Eulmore, you see, but the surrounding regions of Kholusia as well, and I for one would welcome any man or woman willing to take up arms for that cause. Indeed, I told him as much, and he seemed relieved to hear it. It was on that note that we parted ways. He headed outside, as I recall."
66,"TEXT_LUCKMG106_03678_SYSTEM_000_075","Your exchange with Cornenne has taught you about “The perilous state of Eulmore's defenses.”"
67,"TEXT_LUCKMG106_03678_HATHENBET_000_080","Aye, I recall a man fittin' that description. Asked to speak with the poor buggers lately come from Wright."
68,"TEXT_LUCKMG106_03678_HATHENBET_000_081","Said he wanted to know the state of things down in the Derelicts. And you can be sure we gave him an earful. Lack of food, medicine, clothin'─there was plenty to tell."
69,"TEXT_LUCKMG106_03678_HATHENBET_000_082","We hunt high and low for whatever we can scavenge, and it's barely enough to fill our bellies. But folk here don't just want to survive, they want to thrive!"
70,"TEXT_LUCKMG106_03678_HATHENBET_000_083","When he heard that, he started mumblin' to himself. Somethin' about findin' us work, I think."
71,"TEXT_LUCKMG106_03678_HATHENBET_000_084","Fair play to him, though─not content with havin' his ear chewed about the Derelicts, he asked about the other settlements an' all. After that, I can't really say. Looked like he was headed for Gatetown when I last saw him."
72,"TEXT_LUCKMG106_03678_SYSTEM_000_085","Your exchange with Hathenbet has taught you about “The poor living conditions of Kholusia's downtrodden.”"
73,"TEXT_LUCKMG106_03678_MOWEN_000_090","I know not what Master Chai is planning, but if he intends to bring business back to Eulmore, he has my wholehearted support."
74,"TEXT_LUCKMG106_03678_CORNENNE_000_095","Master Chai seemed genuinely concerned over our lack of numbers. Would that we had the money to hire more guards..."
75,"TEXT_LUCKMG106_03678_HATHENBET_000_100","What? I told you everythin' I know. If you're after that Chai bloke, you won't find him here."
76,"TEXT_LUCKMG106_03678_KAISHIRR_000_105","Any luck? I got nowhere myself, but it sounds like Alphinaud might have."
77,"TEXT_LUCKMG106_03678_ALPHINAUD_000_120","Ah, there you are. How did you fare? Have you learned anything which might offer a clue as to Master Chai's whereabouts?"
78,"TEXT_LUCKMG106_03678_ALPHINAUD_000_121","Interesting..."
79,"TEXT_LUCKMG106_03678_ALPHINAUD_000_122","He apparently paid a visit to the Queen Bee as well."
80,"TEXT_LUCKMG106_03678_ALPHINAUD_000_123","They discussed the possibility of granting admission to customers from outside Eulmore, an idea to which the proprietor was surprisingly receptive."
81,"TEXT_LUCKMG106_03678_KAISHIRR_000_124","Sounds like he's got big plans for the place. Eulmore, I mean─not the Bee."
82,"TEXT_LUCKMG106_03678_ALPHINAUD_000_125","Perhaps. But the question remains─where did he go after leaving the city?"
