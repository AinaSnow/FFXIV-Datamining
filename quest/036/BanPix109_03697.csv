49,"TEXT_BANPIX109_03697_UINNEE_000_001","Moss fungus often grows on graves, and because of this, Kholusians believe it to be a most baleful thing, and a harbinger of death, disease, and all sort of other nasty things. Because of this, many children have nightmares of being chased after by giant moss funguses! Is it moss funguses?"
50,"TEXT_BANPIX109_03697_UINNEE_000_002","Anyhow, this got me thinking. Wouldn't it be <Emphasis>so</Emphasis> sweet if <Emphasis>someone</Emphasis> put these poor dreamers' hearts at ease by bringing me the cap of a slain moss fungus, that I could spin it into a dream to show the children that there's nothing to fear about these funny-looking creatures?"
51,"TEXT_BANPIX109_03697_UINNEE_000_003","I'm not asking you to do this. Heavens no! I'm merely saying that <Emphasis>if</Emphasis> someone were inclined to perform this kind gesture, all they would need to do is take an oh-so-short trip to Sextuplet Shallow and rip the cap off one of the unsuspecting moss funguseses that live there. Don't worry, though─I'm sure my dreamers won't mind living in abject fear for another day or two."
52,"TEXT_BANPIX109_03697_UINNEE_000_010","Hm? You have something for me? But I didn't even ask you for anything!"
53,"TEXT_BANPIX109_03697_UINNEE_000_011","The cap of a moss fungus! However did you know that I was looking for one of these? It's almost as if you had the power to enter <Emphasis>my</Emphasis> mind! But whatever can I do to reward your selfless and entirely self-motivated gesture?"
54,"TEXT_BANPIX109_03697_UINNEE_000_012","I know, I'll tell you another story about moss fungus! Once upon a time in a mortal kingdom that is no more, people would sometimes play little tricks on those they didn't like by sneaking a teensy-weensy bit of moss fungus poison into their drinks every day."
55,"TEXT_BANPIX109_03697_UINNEE_000_013","Guess what would happen then? The poor person would gradually grow sick and eventually die, and nobody would be the wiser! That's quite the trick, don't you think? Why, I wish I'd thought of it myself! By the way, can I interest you in a sip of water before you go? Tee hee!"
