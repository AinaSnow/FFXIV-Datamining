80,"TEXT_LUCKMD103_03608_RYNE_000_082","There are only two left on the list, but I'll need to ask about this one. I've looked high and low, and I can't seem to find it anywhere. Would you mind collecting the other? I would hate to delay any longer than I already have."
81,"TEXT_LUCKMD103_03608_RYNE_000_083","You're looking for something with soft leaves that's very fragrant─“in an unmistakably medicinal way,” I was told. We only need two sprigs or so."
82,"TEXT_LUCKMD103_03608_RYNE_000_084","Once you've got them, you can bring them directly to Chessamile. Whoever gets there first can explain that the other will be back shortly. Thank you─I appreciate the help!"

86,"TEXT_LUCKMD103_03608_THANCRED_000_100","I see you got roped into helping. Some things never change, eh?"
87,"TEXT_LUCKMD103_03608_RYNE_000_105","I asked someone who looked like they knew what they were doing, and they pointed me toward the herb I was looking for right away! I hope you didn't have too much trouble with yours."
88,"TEXT_LUCKMD103_03608_CHESSAMILE_000_110","Ah, Minfilia told me that you would be bringing the rest."
89,"TEXT_LUCKMD103_03608_CHESSAMILE_000_111","Marvelous. With this, I can replenish our store of medicines. We're struggling to keep up with the number of wounded that are being brought in."
90,"TEXT_LUCKMD103_03608_CHESSAMILE_000_112","I wasn't on the field, but it doesn't matter. The patients' faces make plain that it was a horrible battle."
91,"TEXT_LUCKMD103_03608_CHESSAMILE_000_113","And we're still fighting it, I suppose, though with bitter medicine rather than sharp steel. But we'll win─I promise you that."
92,"TEXT_LUCKMD103_03608_THANCRED_000_114","It seems that I owe you an apology for dragging you to yet another battlefield when you've just come off the front lines!"
93,"TEXT_LUCKMD103_03608_THANCRED_000_115","In both cases, I'm sure your efforts saved more than a few. With Spagyrics in good working order, the Crystarium's people will be well cared for."
94,"TEXT_LUCKMD103_03608_THANCRED_000_116","More lie ahead, of course─battles only you can fight. Not that we intend to let you do it alone. But that's a matter to discuss with the Exarch."
95,"TEXT_LUCKMD103_03608_SOLDIER03608_000_117","(-???-)You know the Exarch?"
96,"TEXT_LUCKMD103_03608_THANCRED_000_118","We do. Was there something you needed?"
97,"TEXT_LUCKMD103_03608_SOLDIER03608_000_119","I need you to tell him something. For me."
98,"TEXT_LUCKMD103_03608_SOLDIER03608_000_120","My dearest friend, you see... He was there on the battlefield with me. But only the one of us is here to speak of it."
99,"TEXT_LUCKMD103_03608_SOLDIER03608_000_121","At the end, before the wound killed him, I heard his dying words."

101,"TEXT_LUCKMD103_03608_SOLDIER03608_000_123","I don't know how the Exarch feels about what happened out there. I don't know if what Vauthry said is true─if our losses were our just deserts, and we doom ourselves to worse by continuing to fight this fight."
102,"TEXT_LUCKMD103_03608_SOLDIER03608_000_124","But I <Emphasis>believe</Emphasis> in the Warrior of Darkness. In the Crystal Exarch. I don't think what they've done is wrong, and I don't think we're wrong to fight with them, either."
103,"TEXT_LUCKMD103_03608_SOLDIER03608_000_125","My friend, he smiled in the end. Just as he smiled when he raised his glass to celebrate the return of the night. That's how I want to remember him."
104,"TEXT_LUCKMD103_03608_SOLDIER03608_000_126","So I... I want to tell the Exarch. Don't give up. Don't give in. Please."
105,"TEXT_LUCKMD103_03608_THANCRED_000_127","We'll tell him. You have my word."
