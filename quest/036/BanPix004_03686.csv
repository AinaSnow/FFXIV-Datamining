※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANPIX004_03686_SEQ_01","Tyr Beq continues to be troubled by the possibility that An Lad might be the reincarnation of the previous Titania─and their friend. Assuming this is true, then the pale pixie carries the fallen faerie king's torment as if it were their own. Desiring to help An Lad, Tyr Beq heads into Lyhe Mheg to meet with the little boy you aided in Mord Souq, that you might learn what came to pass in his dream.

※You may enter Lyhe Mheg by speaking with Thon Sul in Lydha Lran.
※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANPIX004_03686_SEQ_02","You arrive in Lyhe Mheg to find the boy, who reveals that he briefly spoke with An Lad in his dream and tried to befriend them. Though the pixie's attempt to create water resulted in a nightmare, he is grateful nonetheless, for it served to remind him of his promise to his sister. Having recounted to you these events, the child returns to the waking world."
3,"TEXT_BANPIX004_03686_SEQ_03","Though An Lad's plight still weighs heavily on Tyr Beq, for now they set them aside in their mind in favor of investigating the next region: the Rak'tika Greatwood. According to Ezel, the nightmares are concentrated in Slitherbough, and you set forth for the forest settlement."
4,"TEXT_BANPIX004_03686_SEQ_04","You join your companions in the Rak'tika Greatwood, and split up to find a slumbering child."
5,"TEXT_BANPIX004_03686_SEQ_05","After a brief search, you come upon a little girl in the midst of a nightmare, and Ezel confirms that she is the source. However, she rouses before you can tend to her, and in distressed tones, reveals snippets of her past. It would seem a fire killed animals she considered her friends, a tragedy that gave rise to a fervent desire for approval. Comforted by Tyr Beq, she resumes her slumber, affording Ezel a chance to devour the nightmare. It is then that An Lad chooses to appear, but they do not linger long─and neither does Ezel, who rushes off to regurgitate the nightmare. You and Tyr Beq hasten after the familiar, ready to put your respective skills to use."

7,"TEXT_BANPIX004_03686_SEQ_07","Following a quick word, you and your companions head back to Slitherbough, where you left the little girl slumbering."
8,"TEXT_BANPIX004_03686_SEQ_08","You return to find the little girl not only awake but also aware of your intervention in her dream. She reveals that she has prophetic dreams, and foresaw the sin eater attack at Fort Gohn two years ago, but her warnings were ignored on account of her being a child. Made to feel powerless, she has since dedicated herself to becoming a respected priestess. Alas, the fear of failure always hounded her, and the recent onset of nightmares caused her to feel powerless all over again. She had just about given up hope when you vanquished the nightmare, thereby helping her be at peace with herself. Giving you her thanks, she takes her leave to resume her training with newfound positivity. Your mission in Rak'tika accomplished, you make your way back to Lyhe Mheg to open the fourth gate."

Tyr Beq makes an effort to reach out to them, only to be struck by a mysterious spell and subsequently spurned. An Lad then vanishes, and Ezel suggests that you return to Lydha Lran for the time being."
11,"TEXT_BANPIX004_03686_SEQ_11","Ezel posits that, had Tyr Beq shared An Lad's needs, the spell would have made them into the source for another nightmare.
