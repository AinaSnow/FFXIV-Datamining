1,"TEXT_BANPIX005_03687_SEQ_01","Being on the receiving end of An Lad's spell has left Tyr Beq extremely drowsy, and only the ghastly thought of being sucked upon by Ezel is keeping them awake. The familiar suggests inspecting Lyhe Mheg for anomalies, and while there, taking the opportunity to check on the little girl in Slitherbough.

※You may enter Lyhe Mheg by speaking with Thon Sul in Lydha Lran.
※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANPIX005_03687_SEQ_02","Arriving in Lyhe Mheg, you speak with the little girl, who is happier now that she has been freed from her fear of failure. She then reveals that she too met with An Lad in her dreams. Seeing the pale pixie's loneliness, she tried to reach out to them, only to end up being caught in the nightmare. Having learned all that you could, you and your companions reconvene."
3,"TEXT_BANPIX005_03687_SEQ_03","Tyr Beq is more determined than ever to help An Lad and become their friend. To that end, you turn your attention to the task of reopening the fifth gate, which you deduce leads to Il Mheg, where the source of the nightmares is none other than An Lad themself. At that moment, Tyr Beq finally succumbs to sleep. While the pixie rests, Ezel suggests asking the fae folk about the previous Titania, the better to understand An Lad's heart."
4,"TEXT_BANPIX005_03687_SEQ_04","Speaking with various fae folk, you learn not only about the faerie king, but their connection to Tyr Beq besides. Thus informed, you head back to Lydha Lran to share your findings with Ezel."
5,"TEXT_BANPIX005_03687_SEQ_05","Tyr Beq awakens as you and Ezel trade notes on Titania. Though at first annoyed by your prying, the pixie is gladdened that their departed friend hasn't been forgotten. Tyr Beq explains that, in the past, when no one else wanted anything to do with them, their friend alone accepted them as they were. This reminiscence sparks an epiphany, and they believe that An Lad simply wants for someone to do the same for them. Thus it is decided that you will enter Lyhe Mheg, there to find and save the tormented pixie."
6,"TEXT_BANPIX005_03687_SEQ_06","Even before Thon Sul speaks, it's clear from their expression that trouble is afoot. A terrible power is welling up within Lyhe Mheg, and An Lad is likely the cause. With nary a pause, Tyr Beq sallies forth to stop whatever is unfolding within, and Ezel hurriedly follows after them. Requiring no urging, you turn to Thon Sul to be transported to Lyhe Mheg."
7,"TEXT_BANPIX005_03687_SEQ_07","Setting foot inside Lyhe Mheg, you are greeted with a dreadful sight. By questioning their own existence, An Lad is causing their very essence to unravel, the garden along with it. You fight your way through the chaos, and at length come face-to-face with An Lad's own nightmare. With your strength combined, you and yours succeed in vanquishing the creature, thereby delivering the dream realm from oblivion.

8,"TEXT_BANPIX005_03687_SEQ_08","Thanks to Tyr Beq's unconditional acceptance, An Lad finally finds a place to belong, and encouraged by new friends, they use their power to bring Lyhe Mheg into its full splendor."
9,"TEXT_BANPIX005_03687_SEQ_09","Tyr Beq offers you their heartfelt thanks for your part in protecting Lyhe Mheg, and together you return to Lydha Lran to assure everyone that all is well again."
10,"TEXT_BANPIX005_03687_SEQ_10","With Tyr Beq vouching for them, An Lad has found acceptance among their fellow pixies. And though Lyhe Mheg has been restored to its full splendor, the Dreamspinners' work is never done; more dream bubbles are always needed to ensure that the Garden of Dreams remains beautiful and full of fun. To that end, Tyr Beq bids you continue lending them your aid─for the happiness of pixies and mortals alike."
