1,"TEXT_LUCKMG108_03680_SEQ_01","Rather than build Talos from scratch, Chai-Nuzz proposes capturing the long-abandoned Talos which wander the wilds of Kholusia. A singularly dangerous endeavor, but one which holds no terror for him, knowing as he does that the perfect tools for the task are waiting for you at Top Rung."
2,"TEXT_LUCKMG108_03680_SEQ_02","The reason for Chai-Nuzz's uncharacteristic self-confidence soon becomes apparent when he shows you a crate filled with canisters whose contents can incapacitate Talos. Moreover, they can be thrown from a distance, making the task surprisingly risk-free. So risk-free, in fact, that Chai-Nuzz volunteers to do the deed himself. He still requires support, however, lest he run afoul of the local wildlife. To that end, you set out for the Quick Way in search of a vantage point from which to warn him of danger."
3,"TEXT_LUCKMG108_03680_SEQ_03","With heart in throat and canisters in hand, Chai-Nuzz braves the wilds of Kholusia, succeeding at length in subduing a trio of Talos. As the last of them succumbs, you see him pause, seemingly awestruck by the scale of his own achievement. Or perhaps injured. You rush down to be certain."
4,"TEXT_LUCKMG108_03680_SEQ_04","Your concerns vanish as you near a visibly elated Chai-Nuzz, now the proud owner of three Talos which he is eager to dispatch to Eulmore. After a few adjustments, they spring back to life, and he sends them marching off in the direction of the city.

At the end of a tiring trek through Kholusia, you arrive in Gatetown to find the Talos have attracted a crowd. Among them, you spy Lady Chai, who is near speechless at the sight of her husband. She duly rushes over to him, wasting no time in showing him the strength of her affection. A strength which renders him briefly unconscious."
5,"TEXT_LUCKMG108_03680_SEQ_05","Doubts finally assuaged, Wrenden expresses his admiration for Chai-Nuzz and the devotion of those close to him. Taking note of the chattering throng which has formed around the Talos, he declares that it will soon be time for the intrepid entrepreneur to address his fellow citizens as mayor."

49,"TEXT_LUCKMG108_03680_ALPHINAUD_000_005","Do you see it? There is a fire in Master Chai's eyes that was not there when first we met. A fire we had best keep kindled if we wish to see Eulmore change for the better."
50,"TEXT_LUCKMG108_03680_WRENDEN_000_010","You had a hand in constructing that giant Talos to the north, did you not?"
51,"TEXT_LUCKMG108_03680_WRENDEN_000_011","When the Eulmoran volunteers began arriving, I hid myself away, lest I be recognized...thus depriving myself of what I am reliably informed was a once-in-a-lifetime spectacle. Bugger."
52,"TEXT_LUCKMG108_03680_CHAINUZZ_000_020","Wrenden is quite right. Building Talos from scratch would require time we simply do not have."
53,"TEXT_LUCKMG108_03680_CHAINUZZ_000_021","Which is why I propose to make use of the long-abandoned Talos which wander the wilds of Kholusia."

56,"TEXT_LUCKMG108_03680_ALPHINAUD_000_045","It is one thing to repair an immobile Talos, as Urianger did, but quite another to <Emphasis>catch</Emphasis> one, surely? Does this not sound a trifle dangerous?"

59,"TEXT_LUCKMG108_03680_CHAINUZZ_000_071","This chest contains canisters filled with a dashedly potent insulating powder capable of halting the flow of aether in a Talos. We need only get within throwing distance of one and let fly."
60,"TEXT_LUCKMG108_03680_ALPHINAUD_000_072","...Thus disabling them without damaging them! Ingenious!"
61,"TEXT_LUCKMG108_03680_CHAINUZZ_000_073","An old trick of the trade, nothing more. Once disabled, it should be a simple enough matter to get them to march to Eulmore. More extensive repairs can wait."

74,"TEXT_LUCKMG108_03680_CHAINUZZ_000_086","And to make sure I do, I will require your help. It is as Kai-Shirr says─these lands are dangerous if one is not careful.

75,"TEXT_LUCKMG108_03680_CHAINUZZ_000_088","Good. Then let's be off to the Quick Way, through the north gate, and see if we can't find a suitable vantage point for you."

79,"TEXT_LUCKMG108_03680_CHAINUZZ_000_115","All right. Nothing to worry about. Just a simple matter of sneaking up on the Talos while avoiding the slavering, bloodthirsty beasts lurking behind every rock. Child's play... Ahem. When you're ready, let us begin."
