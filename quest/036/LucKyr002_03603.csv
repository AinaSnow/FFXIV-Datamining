49,"TEXT_LUCKYR002_03603_MOWEN_000_002","Master Alphinaud has spoken quite highly of you and your unparalleled artistic abilities. Quite highly indeed..."
50,"TEXT_LUCKYR002_03603_MOWEN_000_003","Forgive me my boldness, but I should be most honored if you were to register with us as a provider of collectables. As compensation, we can offer you a wide variety of goods that I am confident will meet with your approval."
51,"TEXT_LUCKYR002_03603_MOWEN_000_004","Not direct compensation, to be clear. We have adopted a system rather similar to one with which you are doubtless familiar─and which I only recently learned of from Master Alphinaud."

Limiting, perhaps, but you will find that the equipment and materials we have on offer more than make up for any inconvenience."

54,"TEXT_LUCKYR002_03603_MOWEN_000_007","Oh, and I should mention that a negligible portion of the value of all collectables processed will be withheld to account for overhead and other assorted operating expenses. Doubtless I need not explain the necessity of this."
55,"TEXT_LUCKYR002_03603_MOWEN_000_008","The Boutique of Splendors is always on the lookout for new artisans eager to share their talents with the world! Should you happen to know any such individuals, I pray you direct them to us!"
