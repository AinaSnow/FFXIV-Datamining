1,"TEXT_LUCKMF104_03647_SEQ_01","You inform Urianger of your readiness to depart, and he exhorts you to consider a method of travel that will also facilitate breathing and movement beneath the waves. Rather than explain his proposal with wasteful words, however, your ever-enigmatic colleague bids you follow him to Sullen to behold his solution with your own eyes."
2,"TEXT_LUCKMF104_03647_SEQ_02","Urianger meets you at Sullen, and points out an island in the western part of the lake. It would seem that an underwater investigation of the foliage-covered landmass will soon open your eyes to its true nature."
3,"TEXT_LUCKMF104_03647_SEQ_03","You conduct an inspection of the submerged part of the island, and note some interesting peculiarities. Urianger waits above to hear word of your revelations."
4,"TEXT_LUCKMF104_03647_SEQ_04","The Isle of Ken is, as it turns out, an ancient fae being by the name of Bismarck. Urianger attempts to rouse the creature to action, but it takes the intervention of Feo Ul to convince Bismarck to bear you to the ocean's depths. Your journey to the Tempest has begun."
5,"TEXT_LUCKMF104_03647_SEQ_05","Bismarck deposits you on the sea floor, secure within an enormous dome of air created by its mighty breath. Your companions rise shakily to their feet, Urianger's face in particular a mask of relief...

※In the event that you leave the area, speak with Inewyl at Venmont Yards in Kholusia to return to the Tempest."
6,"TEXT_LUCKMF104_03647_SEQ_06","Releasing a long-held breath, Urianger announces your safe arrival in the Tempest. Suspecting that Emet-Selch cannot risk fleeing into the rift while the Exarch is his prisoner, he seems confident that the Ascian is to be found somewhere within this underwater realm. You have only to begin the search..."

56,"TEXT_LUCKMF104_03647_URIANGER_000_032","Thus would I petition the aid of one of the fae─a being with whom I have yet to meet face-to-face."
57,"TEXT_LUCKMF104_03647_URIANGER_000_033","...Rather than waste words on explanation, I bid thee follow me unto the hamlet of Sullen, which lieth to the south and west. All will become abundantly clear, I promise thee."
58,"TEXT_LUCKMF104_03647_URIANGER_000_040","There, to the west. Canst thou discern the hump of an isle rising above the water?"

78,"TEXT_LUCKMF104_03647_URIANGER_000_095","I would enlist its aid to bear us unto the deep, and thence banish the water with an airy sphere, alike in form to the domes which do shelter the hamlets 'neath the Ruby Sea."
79,"TEXT_LUCKMF104_03647_URIANGER_000_096","Within its compass, we may move unencumbered, and defend ourselves when the hour of battle cometh, as it most surely shall. Now, I must needs ask for silence whilst I make my supplication..."

81,"TEXT_LUCKMF104_03647_ALPHINAUD_000_110","Bismarck must be powerful indeed to create a dome of this size. I can only pray to whichever gods are listening that it continues to hold..."
82,"TEXT_LUCKMF104_03647_ALISAIE_000_115","I remember being impressed by the domes of the Ruby Sea, but this makes them look like bubbles in a stream!"
83,"TEXT_LUCKMF104_03647_THANCRED_000_120","With all that water out of the way, we'll be able to venture quite some distance. Emet-Selch must be hiding around here somewhere..."
84,"TEXT_LUCKMF104_03647_RYNE_000_125","This is <Emphasis>amazing</Emphasis>. I can't even see the surface!"
85,"TEXT_LUCKMF104_03647_YSHTOLA_000_130","I daresay Urianger endured much “playful” attention from the pixies to learn the lore of Bismarck. He is nothing if not a dedicated scholar."
86,"TEXT_LUCKMF104_03647_URIANGER_000_140","Haaa... Haaa...<gulp>
Full glad am I...that Bismarck was true to his word."
87,"TEXT_LUCKMF104_03647_URIANGER_000_141","We are arrived in the Tempest, safe and dry. 'Tis here that we shall find the lair of Emet-Selch, and, I believe, the imprisoned Exarch as well."
88,"TEXT_LUCKMF104_03647_URIANGER_000_142","For an Ascian alone, it is of course a trifling matter to flee unto the rift─yet I suspect such travel is nigh impossible with a mortal in one's custody."
89,"TEXT_LUCKMF104_03647_URIANGER_000_143","Nay, he would not soon risk his prize when the Exarch's very body serveth as the key to the Crystal Tower and its powers of temporal transportation."
90,"TEXT_LUCKMF104_03647_URIANGER_000_144","Thus am I all but certain that this underwater realm harboreth our friend and enemy both. We have but to find them."
