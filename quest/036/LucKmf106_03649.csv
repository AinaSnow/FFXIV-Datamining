65,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_057","But if not the Ronkans, then who? Who were these ancients the Ondo claim as the architects of their sanctuary?"
66,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_058","I suspect our answer lies with the reason Emet-Selch withdrew here to the Tempest."
67,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_059","He may simply have wished to retreat somewhere mere mortals would struggle to reach...but there are many such remote locations. Why here, specifically?"
68,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_060","Emet-Selch is devoted to his role, and thus we might assume his choice of stronghold somehow serves the Ascian agenda."

74,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_062","That is my theory, that these structures are remnants of a time before history─of a star that was yet whole and unbroken."
75,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_063","That was my first thought as well. Yet no matter how superior the materials, a ruin is just a ruin. 'Tis naught that would decide a battle's outcome."
76,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_064","Which brings us to my second theory: that he has some other, more personal connection to this site. What if these structures are remnants of a time before history─of a star that was yet whole and unbroken?"

80,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_068","Here, in the first scene...
By Emet-Selch's own words, it depicts a city of eons past and the disaster which befell it."
81,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_069","The design is much simplified, of course, but do you see the similarities between its towers and those you have just inspected?"
82,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_070","We are close to the truth, I feel. Let us search the surrounds for another tower─one which matches the picture near enough to remove all doubt."
83,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_071","From what I have seen, naught more than sand and more sand lies to the east, and the south held no such structures. I suggest we try our luck further to the northwest."

89,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_081","Though I cannot guess at its purpose, it must have been an imposing sight. How much of the tower's height lies hidden beneath the ground, I wonder..."
90,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_082","Centuries of our history have settled upon such ruins. Countless layers of dust and sediment..."
91,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_083","...An entire civilization, its existence forgotten by all except a handful of Ascians."

93,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_085","But let us focus on what we've learned thus far. The Ondo chieftain spoke of mysteries stirring─of a land illuminated."
94,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_086","Judging by his words, he believes this phenomenon related to the ancients' return."
95,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_087","Thus can we surmise that what the Ondo saw shining in the abyss was, in all likelihood, yet another remnant of this age-old civilization."
96,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_088","And who else would “light the lanterns” as Ryne put it, than Emet-Selch himself? 'Tis almost certain he is there!"
97,"TEXT_LUCKMF106_03649_YSHTOLA_000_090","But if we are to find this stronghold in a timely manner, it seems gaining the Ondo's trust remains our swiftest path forward."
