2,"TEXT_LUCKME105_03634_SEQ_02","As you observe the final stages of the Ladder's restoration, Emet-Selch arrives unannounced. In the course of waxing sentimental, he raises the prospect of you joining him as an equal─a complete existence in a complete world. No sooner does the Ascian take his leave than Ardbert appears in his place. As the Talos come to life to hearty cheers, he speaks to you of his struggles against solitude, and warns you against making a choice that leaves you alone. At that moment, Alphinaud and Alisaie rush up to you excitedly. The Ladder lives again, and you join the twins as the first souls to ride the lift in twenty years."

5,"TEXT_LUCKME105_03634_SEQ_05","Scanning the area around the village, you spot the mysterious person, who appeared to be spying in your direction. Uncomfortable at not knowing who is out there, Alisaie suggests that you investigate the village."
6,"TEXT_LUCKME105_03634_SEQ_06","While the village appears devoid of people, there is evidence to suggest that it is very much inhabited, and you take your findings to Alphinaud."
7,"TEXT_LUCKME105_03634_SEQ_07","As you ponder what to do about the hiding villagers, a voice calls out. It is revealed to belong to none other than Tristol, the young artist whose life you saved in Kholusia. He informs you that the village, Amity, is a settlement for those who survived being exiled from Eulmore, and upon learning that you are in pursuit of Vauthry, promises to aid you in your quest."
