1,"TEXT_LUCKMD116_03621_SEQ_01","You left for Nabaath Areng with a girl named Minfilia, and return with one named Ryne, whom your fellow Scions welcome with open arms. Still more hearteningly, she is eager to put her newfound abilities to good use, revealing that she senses the presence of a Lightwarden to the west. This coincides with Y'shtola's own suspicions after surveying a site known as Malikah's Well. Seemingly, the extensive underground waterway represents a suitable place to hide, and so that is where you will begin your search."
2,"TEXT_LUCKMD116_03621_SEQ_02","After a short trek westward, you arrive at the edge of a cavernous maw─the entrance to Malikah's Well. You quickly confer with the other Scions, before steeling yourself to step into the unknown.

※Speak with your companion NPCs outside the instance entrance if you wish to enlist them for this duty.
※Use the Duty Finder if you wish to complete the instance alongside fellow players."
3,"TEXT_LUCKMD116_03621_SEQ_03","You wend your way through the underground corridors of the well, its denizens impeding your every step, until you come face-to-face with the Lightwarden. Ignoring the protestations of your already aching limbs, you hurl yourself into battle once more and, after a drawn-out struggle, the beast is laid low."
4,"TEXT_LUCKMD116_03621_SEQ_04","To your relief, the path leading out of the well is blessedly empty, and soon you emerge beneath a spectacular night sky. The sight of it leaves your fellow Scions in awe, Alisaie seeming especially affected by the view."
5,"TEXT_LUCKMD116_03621_SEQ_05","With each hard-fought victory, the Light's grip over Norvrandt loosens, Kholusia now serving as its final foothold. Could the salvation of the First at last be within reach? It is a stirring thought, and one likely large in the minds of your comrades as you make ready to return to the Crystal Tower."

Though it was Grandfather's legacy which first brought me to Eorzea, I would never have become a Scion were it not for her. Indeed, there would <Emphasis>be</Emphasis> no Scions, and two worlds would be the worse for our absence."

65,"TEXT_LUCKMD116_03621_YSHTOLA_000_038","It fell into disuse after the Flood, whereupon the miners of Amh Araeng thought to turn part of it into an excavation site."

87,"TEXT_LUCKMD116_03621_THANCRED_000_100","No need to worry about me. Urianger and Y'shtola were quite thorough in their ministrations."
88,"TEXT_LUCKMD116_03621_THANCRED_000_101","A pity their magicks did nothing for my clothes."
89,"TEXT_LUCKMD116_03621_THANCRED_000_102","At any rate, we cannot well stop now. Not after all Ryne and Minfilia have given to bring us this far."
90,"TEXT_LUCKMD116_03621_RYNE_000_105","The Warden's presence feels...familiar somehow. Now that I think about it, it reminds me of..."
91,"TEXT_LUCKMD116_03621_RYNE_000_106","But that makes no sense. Sorry. I'm sure I'm just imagining things."
92,"TEXT_LUCKMD116_03621_URIANGER_000_110","Lest thou worry, I did relay unto Magnus word of thine untimely accident whilst I waited for thee to return from thine audience with the Oracle. He hath since reclaimed his Talos and trolley both, and meaneth to begin repairs anon."
93,"TEXT_LUCKMD116_03621_URIANGER_000_111","For a blessing, the damage was but superficial, the leonine heart unmarred by Ran'jit's onslaught."
94,"TEXT_LUCKMD116_03621_YSHTOLA_000_115","I was surprised to hear Ran'jit survived the fall. Though I suppose I did the same."

And yet our travails are far from over..."
