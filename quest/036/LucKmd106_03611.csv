55,"TEXT_LUCKMD106_03611_ZHUNZUN_000_024","Before, there was a hulking thing of stone─the Talos. It opened the gate, they say."

68,"TEXT_LUCKMD106_03611_THANCRED_000_080","Bit of a mess, isn't it? But the mechanisms for dispatching the trolley are here, just as Zhun Zun said."
69,"TEXT_LUCKMD106_03611_THANCRED_000_081","Unfortunately, anyone who might know how to use them is not. We might wait for Zhun Zun's mysterious miners to appear, or have a look around and see if we can deduce anything useful in their absence. I'm in favor of the latter."

82,"TEXT_LUCKMD106_03611_URIANGER_000_117","Nor doth it appear to be the sole example of its kind. The proliferation of Talos fragments, as well as the enormity of the mechanisms here, suggest a considerable number were once in operation."
83,"TEXT_LUCKMD106_03611_URIANGER_000_118","Alas, this specimen and its fellows now lie lifeless and broken, and I know not how to repair them that they might facilitate our passage through the gate."

86,"TEXT_LUCKMD106_03611_THANCRED_000_121","Let's ask them what it is, shall we?"
87,"TEXT_LUCKMD106_03611_THANCRED_000_122","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, I do believe you'll find a person of some interest skulking in the shadows behind the warehouses on the northwestern side of the tracks."
