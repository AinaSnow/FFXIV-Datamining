49,"TEXT_BANPIX111_03699_UINNEE_000_002","It's my friend, you see. We made a promise to go frolicking in Lyhe Mheg, but they're nowhere to be seen! They must've fallen asleep! Can you believe it!?"
50,"TEXT_BANPIX111_03699_UINNEE_000_003","Hmph! I'd better stay here on the off chance they come looking for me. What I need is someone to go and find them in my stead... And who else would show up just in time but my favorite mortal! Well then, off you go!"
51,"TEXT_BANPIX111_03699_SLEEPINGPIXIE03699_000_011","Unnnh... Just forty more winks... <snore>"

55,"TEXT_BANPIX111_03699_UINNEE_000_020","You found them! That's terrific! So...where are they?"
56,"TEXT_BANPIX111_03699_UINNEE_000_021","Hmm... Such a deep sleep can only mean one thing. They'll probably be returning to Glorianda any day now."
57,"TEXT_BANPIX111_03699_UINNEE_000_022","What are you looking at me like that for? Must I explain everything? <sigh> Very well."
58,"TEXT_BANPIX111_03699_UINNEE_000_023","You see, even we pixies don't know where we come from. One day we simply awaken─with a poof, or so I like to think! We're alive! And then eventually we lie down to go to sleep and simply fade away..."
59,"TEXT_BANPIX111_03699_UINNEE_000_024","Some say we pass into a never-ending dream, where we return to Glorianda, the legendary Forebear of Pixies."
60,"TEXT_BANPIX111_03699_UINNEE_000_025","Or maybe that sleepyhead is just being lazy! Anyway, I've got plenty to keep me busy while I wait for them to wake up, like sending silly mortals running here, there, and everywhere to carry out my bidding! Muahahaha!"
61,"TEXT_BANPIX111_03699_UINNEE_000_026","Pixies who sleep for too long sometimes fade away into their dreams, where they return to Glorianda. That silly so-and-so has been going to Mithai Glorianda rather frequently, so maybe their time has come?"
62,"TEXT_BANPIX111_03699_UINNEE_000_027","Not that it's any of my concern. I just don't like to be kept waiting! But you'll keep me amused in the meantime, won't you?"
