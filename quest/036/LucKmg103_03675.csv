54,"TEXT_LUCKMG103_03675_BEQLUGG_000_111","...White auracite, you say? An intriguing proposition."
55,"TEXT_LUCKMG103_03675_BEQLUGG_000_112","But one which fails to account for the present state of your souls."
56,"TEXT_LUCKMG103_03675_BEQLUGG_100_112","They have become highly charged, likely as a consequence of having maintained tangible forms for so long. In such an energetic, unstable state, there is no telling what may happen to their souls within the auracite. They could very well become immutable to transference, never to be restored to their bodies."
57,"TEXT_LUCKMG103_03675_YSHTOLA_000_113","Then...would it be possible to force our souls into a state of dormancy, prior to transference?"
58,"TEXT_LUCKMG103_03675_BEQLUGG_000_114","In theory, yes. But the soul is not a candle to be snuffed out and relit on a whim."
59,"TEXT_LUCKMG103_03675_ALISAIE_100_114","Well, that sounds ominous. What exactly would rendering our souls dormant entail?"
60,"TEXT_LUCKMG103_03675_BEQLUGG_101_114","In order to maintain a corporeal form, your souls constantly draw aether from your surroundings. This process must be halted, and the resulting surfeit of aether removed."

68,"TEXT_LUCKMG103_03675_BEQLUGG_000_124","It was my faith in man I lost, not my compassion."
69,"TEXT_LUCKMG103_03675_YSHTOLA_000_125","Well, I see no need for all of us to accompany you. While you escort our guest to the Inn, I will assist Urianger in creating the requisite auracite."
70,"TEXT_LUCKMG103_03675_MYSTERYVOICE_000_126","I believe my talents would be better applied to that endeavor as well. Might I leave the three of you to assist Beq Lugg as necessary?"

80,"TEXT_LUCKMG103_03675_BEQLUGG_000_183","Not too bright, are you, boy? The same as all poor souls corrupted by the Light─he will become a sin eater."
81,"TEXT_LUCKMG103_03675_ALISAIE_000_184","You don't know that. We've defeated the Wardens and banished the Light from the night sky. Halric was completely unresponsive before, but now..."

85,"TEXT_LUCKMG103_03675_ALISAIE_000_188","What sort of treatment?"
86,"TEXT_LUCKMG103_03675_BEQLUGG_000_189","In the course of my studies of the soul, I once created a tonic which could temporarily stimulate the aether in one's body. After some refinement, it came to be used by the knights of Voeburt."
87,"TEXT_LUCKMG103_03675_BEQLUGG_100_189","Then for far darker purposes..."
88,"TEXT_LUCKMG103_03675_BEQLUGG_101_189","Lest it fall into the wrong hands, I swore never again to make it. But for their sakes, I will break that oath."

101,"TEXT_LUCKMG103_03675_BEQLUGG_000_270","Now then, have you noted any change in the patients?"
102,"TEXT_LUCKMG103_03675_ALPHINAUD_000_271","A notable rise in body temperature and increased motor function. In most of the patients, at least."
103,"TEXT_LUCKMG103_03675_ALISAIE_000_272","The more severely afflicted show no response."
104,"TEXT_LUCKMG103_03675_BEQLUGG_000_273","As I feared, then."
105,"TEXT_LUCKMG103_03675_BEQLUGG_000_274","'Tis true that with the restoration of night, the corrupting influence of Light will no longer grow. And yes, their bodies will naturally return to equilibrium given time..."
106,"TEXT_LUCKMG103_03675_BEQLUGG_000_275","But this holds true only for their corporeal aether. Their <Emphasis>incorporeal</Emphasis> aether─that of the soul─is not so easily mended."
