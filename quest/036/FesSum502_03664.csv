※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESSUM502_03664_SEQ_01","Haermaga thanks you for accepting the offer to help teach the overzealous R'fhul Tia an important lesson. He then lays down the rules: the first one to accumulate four Faire vouchers will be declared the victor. Faire vouchers can be won by successfully completing any of three events: the Eorzean Nimble Warrior course, which will yield four vouchers, or the Iron Culinarian Challenge and Angling Extravaganza, which will yield one apiece. He further explains that you can take on any event as many times as you wish. With your objective clearly in mind, you set out to put on a clear demonstration of your adventuring abilities.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESSUM502_03664_SEQ_02","Your finely honed skills allow you to make short work of the challenges of the faire, and you swiftly accumulate the four vouchers required. You deliver them to Haermaga, who declares you the victor, and further explains his reasons for proposing this contest in the first place. After a short chat, he sends you out to look for R'fhul Tia, whose failure to return has the grand chaperone concerned."
3,"TEXT_FESSUM502_03664_SEQ_03","You find R'majha standing by herself on the beach. She explains that her brother is making an earnest attempt to succeed in the competition, but she is unaware of how many vouchers he has managed to procure. She mentions that she saw him talking to a particular personage standing a short ways away, and suggests that the two of you do the same in hopes of gleaning further information."
4,"TEXT_FESSUM502_03664_SEQ_04","You speak with Beaudefoin, who observes that R'fhul Tia is just about to take on the Eorzean Ninja Warrior course. He offers to provide a rousing play-by-play for R'majha's benefit, then proceeds to do exactly that as R'fhul Tia soars to the start of the course with great promise...only to fall to an inglorious defeat with his very first jump. R'majha runs off, worried that her brother might be hurt, and you decide to go along to offer what aid and emotional support you may."
5,"TEXT_FESSUM502_03664_SEQ_05","You find R'fhul Tia shaken and stunned but physically no worse for the wear. While he is eager to rush back out and prove that his failure just now was an aberration, his young sister convinces him to get some much-needed rest before he takes on his next challenge. Mistakenly believing that he might yet win his competition with you, he grudgingly acquiesces to her request. Resolving to join them there, you begin thinking of how to break the news to the lad gently."
6,"TEXT_FESSUM502_03664_SEQ_06","You find a well-rested and refreshed R'fhul Tia ready and raring to get back out there and prove himself the more capable adventurer. His enthusiasm is somewhat dampened, however, when you tactfully inform him that, in fact, you have already obtained the necessary four vouchers and claimed your victory. Initially reacting with utter disbelief, he soon comes to the understanding that he had vastly overestimated his own abilities. Confronted with indisputable evidence that he still has a long way to go before becoming a true adventurer, he resolves to follow your advice and example. Promising his dear sister that he will be more cautious and circumspect in the future, he thanks you for providing him with inspiration and a valuable life lesson, and strikes out in search of his next adventure. Your job here done, you decide to return to Haermaga to report on the events of the day."
7,"TEXT_FESSUM502_03664_SEQ_07","Haermaga is heartened by your return, and the tidings that you bring to him. He thanks you once more for serving as a model─not only to R'fhul Tia but to all the aspiring adventurers who have seen you showcase your skills at the Moonfire Faire. He offers you a healthy reward for your efforts, and invites you to return as often as you wish while the festivities are still ongoing."
