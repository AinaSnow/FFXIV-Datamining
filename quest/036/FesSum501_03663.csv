1,"TEXT_FESSUM501_03663_SEQ_01","Mayaru Moyaru is pleased to inform you that now is a most wonderful time of year─the Moonfire Faire is being observed in Costa del Sol. He heartily invites you to take part in the revelry yourself, which you may do simply by making your way to the seaside resort and speaking with Grand Chaperone Haermaga.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESSUM501_03663_SEQ_02","Haermaga, grand chaperone of the Moonfire Faire, welcomes you to this year's festivities, and gives you a summary of all the activities available to faire-goers. The centerpiece is a trumped-up version of the Eorzean Nimble Warrior course, which is complemented by two events of smaller scale, the Iron Culinarian Challenge and the Angling Extravaganza. He follows up his explanation with a request of a more specific nature, asking if you would be willing to provide some veteran guidance to a newly recruited adventurer who Haermaga suspects might be in over his head. Should you be willing to take on the job, speak to the grand chaperone whenever you are ready."
3,"TEXT_FESSUM501_03663_SEQ_03","The adventurer in question is none other than one R'Fhul Tia, an ambitious youth who makes up for what he lacks in experience with what seems to be a limitless store of unfounded confidence. No sooner has the lad introduced himself than does he challenge you to a battle to see which of you can accumulate four Faire vouchers in the fastest time. At Haermaga's behest, you accept his terms, in the hopes that you might impart to the boy a lesson or two along the way."

49,"TEXT_FESSUM501_03663_MAYARUMOYARU_000_001","Greetings, adventurer! Looking for a way to beat the heat? Well, you're in luck! The annual observance of the Moonfire Faire is going on even as we speak!"
50,"TEXT_FESSUM501_03663_MAYARUMOYARU_000_002","Once upon a time─well, just a couple of years ago, in fact─the Moonfire Faire was a time when adventurers would band together to banish the threat of firesome fiery creatures called Bombards."
51,"TEXT_FESSUM501_03663_MAYARUMOYARU_000_003","Now the Bombards are long since gone─at least we hope they are─but the tradition continues as a way to celebrate the daring exploits of adventurers the realm over, and through this, recruit some fresh blood for the realm's Adventurers' Guilds in the process. A worthy cause, I'm sure you'll agree!"
52,"TEXT_FESSUM501_03663_MAYARUMOYARU_000_004","But enough with the chitter-chatter─I'm sure you're eager to join the celebrations yourself, yes?

54,"TEXT_FESSUM501_03663_HAERMAGA_000_010","Well, if it isn't <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! I was wondering when you'd show up! Why, you're such a mainstay around these parts each year that I felt terrible getting the festivities started without you. Anyhow, since you're here, I take it you're ready for another rousing Moonfire Faire?"
55,"TEXT_FESSUM501_03663_HAERMAGA_000_011","The highlight of this year's event is: you guessed it! The return of that time-honored test of agility and acrobatic aptitude known as the Eorzean Nimble Warrior course! And lest you think that you've seen this all before, let me be the first to say that the course has come back better than ever!"
56,"TEXT_FESSUM501_03663_HAERMAGA_000_012","Yes, Master Gegeruju has spared no effort in providing the ultimate challenge for high-flying adventurers! Word has it he even solicited opinions from the lovely ladies in his employ. “Gahahaha! Those kittens have claws, eh?”─or so I overheard him saying."
57,"TEXT_FESSUM501_03663_HAERMAGA_000_013","But there's more to an adventurer's skill set than performing death-defying feats.

There's this adventurer, see, who just signed up at the guild, and we can't help but feel he's in need of some, ah...veteran guidance and direction. We figure you'd be perfect for the job...if it's not too much trouble, of course?"

68,"TEXT_FESSUM501_03663_RFHULTIA_000_033","I'm so glad you came! I have incredible news, and I can think of no one I'd rather share it with. Brace yourself, friend: the mild-mannered boy you knew then is now a gods-honest adventurer! Can you believe it?"

73,"TEXT_FESSUM501_03663_HAERMAGA_000_038","So, ah, R'fhul Tia here just signed up at the Adventurers' Guild just last week. Typically, he'd be out honing his skills in hopes of becoming a full-fledged adventurer, but today he's come home to visit his dear little sister for the Moonfire Faire season. That's nice of him, I suppose?"

Why, just the other day I slew ten fearsome ladybugs in one fell swoop! Guildmaster Ywain of Gridania even told me I had “great potential!”"

84,"TEXT_FESSUM501_03663_HAERMAGA_000_049","Oh dear. Let it never be said that you lack a sense for the dramatic. Well, what do you say, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>?

85,"TEXT_FESSUM501_03663_RFHULTIA_000_050","Haha! I knew you wouldn't back down! But be forewarned, my friend: you'd do well not to underestimate your opponent today. And with that, let the games begin!"
