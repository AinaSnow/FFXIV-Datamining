By the Ixali headwing's words, he could only be one of those hatchlings whose life was spared in exchange for hers. Unwilling to sever the ties of destiny put in place by her master so long before, Miah Molkot calls off the attack. And so, after twenty long years, a temporary truce returns to the Twelveswood."
