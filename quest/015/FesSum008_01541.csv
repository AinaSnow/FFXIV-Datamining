※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESSUM008_01541_SEQ_01","Mayaru Moyaru is quite the demon whisperer; confined within the event venue are womandragoras and sabotenders both. Use any of the 18-ponze cannons at your disposal to batter the former twice and the latter once.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESSUM008_01541_SEQ_02","All targets are moving targets when there are cannons and crowds involved. Despite the difficulties, you have triumphed. Mayaru Moyaru will be relieved to hear how well and precisely you comported yourself."
3,"TEXT_FESSUM008_01541_SEQ_03","Mayaru Moyaru is delighted that this family-friendly event concluded without any bystander injuries. How wonderful it is to see the smiles of the children, and watch them run after the cannonballs. Some actions cannot be undone, but you may always return to the Cannon–do Spirit."
