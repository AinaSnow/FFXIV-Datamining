Rozol Cattlan the Prudent requests the aid of a Disciple of the Hand, and according to the faction knotcounter, you are the only featherless one he trusts with the task.
※The crafting portion of this quest is recommended for Disciples of the Hand level 6 and above, and the battle portion for Disciples of War or Magic level 45 and above."
1,"TEXT_BANIXA304_01517_SEQ_01","The <Emphasis>Dezul Qualan</Emphasis>'s instrument panel is a complex piece of machinery─too complex, in fact, for the clumsy claws of even the most skilled Ixali crafter. Impressed with your work on larger items, Rozol Cattlan believes it time to test your hand at tasks which require more precision. The materials he was able to provide you with; however, the bribe for young Templeton you will have to earn on your own. For whatever reason, he requires a biast claw, of all things. Fortunately, the hills to the west of the Observatorium are literally crawling with hungry biasts.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANIXA304_01517_SEQ_02","Take the bloody biast claw and the instrument panel component materials to Templeton at the Observatorium."
3,"TEXT_BANIXA304_01517_SEQ_03","Templeton is every bit as despicable as advertised, and now you have full access to the Highwind Skyways temporary crafting facilities. Use the materials given to you by the Rozol Cattlan and inspected by Templeton to synthesize a high-quality instrument panel component, and deliver the finished product to the faction.

※In the event that the status <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Facility Access: Production II<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> wears off or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Templeton."
4,"TEXT_BANIXA304_01517_SEQ_04","You have delivered the expertly crafted instrument panel component to Rozol Cattlan the Prudent, leaving him in awe at your skill as well as your willingness to assist his faction, despite the fact you and he are so different. He makes it a point to voice his gratitude to Chief Sezul Totoloc who has made possible this once unthinkable alliance."
