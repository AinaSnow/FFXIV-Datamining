According to Jezul Ahuatan the Second, regard is to be treasured, praise is to be enjoyed, and flattery discarded for the dross it is.
※The crafting portion of this quest is recommended for Disciples of the Hand level 16 and above."
1,"TEXT_BANIXA603_01522_SEQ_01","Jezul Ahuatan has challenged you to craft refabrication components. But first, you must attend to a miner─er, minor─detail. The Camp Dragonhead area is a garden of earthly delights to a seasoned prospector such as yourself. Prise fifteen chunks of furite and five chunks of high-quality furite from the ground to trade for much-needed crafting materials.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANIXA603_01522_SEQ_02","There was an iciness to the ground that you trod, and you are glad to have all the minerals you need. The sprightly sutler may believe he has lost his best prospector, but after one look at you, he will surely discover that he has gained one instead."
3,"TEXT_BANIXA603_01522_SEQ_03","The sprightly sutler trades you the material, but proves to be more interested in supper than superlatives. Still, barley soup goes down easier than humble pie. Think on that as you give Norbettaux the material and have him prepare the crafting facility."
4,"TEXT_BANIXA603_01522_SEQ_04","Norbettaux has prepared the crafting facility for your use. With the materials you have obtained, synthesize two high-quality refabrication components, and deliver them to Jezul Ahuatan at Ehcatl.

※In the event that the status <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Facility Access: Specialization II<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> wears off or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Norbettaux."
5,"TEXT_BANIXA603_01522_SEQ_05","Jezul Ahuatan examines the fruits of your labor and pronounces himself satisfied─with a caveat. Could it be that the sharp-eyed Second somehow saw into your heart? Clearly, there is more to this birdman than showy wings and fast squawks..."
