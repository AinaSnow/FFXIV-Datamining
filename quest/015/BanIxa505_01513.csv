Duzal Meyean the Steady seeks a reliable Disciple of the Hand to assist his team of crafts...birds in the creation of prototype components.
※The crafting portion of this quest is recommended for Disciples of the Hand level 15 and above, and the battle portion for Disciples of War or Magic level 48 and above."
1,"TEXT_BANIXA505_01513_SEQ_01","Duzal Meyean has asked you to synthesize a ceruleum tank component to improve his prototype for the airship <Emphasis>Dezul Qualan</Emphasis>. Proper equipment to craft these items, however, is only found at the Diamond Forge in Revenant's Toll. Speak with forgewife Fyrbryda about receiving permission to utilize the facilities.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANIXA505_01513_SEQ_02","Fyrbryda's rules for the forge are simple: one, all materials brought inside must be inspected for contraband, and two, if anyone wishes to make use of the facilities, they must first provide a generous contribution to the Revenant's Toll chapter of the Adventurers' Guild. Currently, the guild is amassing Garlean fiber to assist Rowena in her development of new armor. Make your way to Castrum Centri and steal a loop of Garlean fiber #43 from the imperial reserves."
3,"TEXT_BANIXA505_01513_SEQ_03","You have obtained a loop of Garlean fiber #43. Deliver it to Fyrbryda at the Diamond Forge before another fledgling adventurer perishes for want of better equipment. Also, do not forget to submit the ceruleum tank component materials to the forgewife for inspection."
4,"TEXT_BANIXA505_01513_SEQ_04","Fyrbryda has granted you access to the Diamond Forge's crafting facilities. Use the materials given to you by Duzal Meyean and inspected by Fyrbryda to synthesize a high-quality ceruleum tank component. Once completed, return to Ehcatl with the item.

※In the event that the status <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Facility Access: Specialization<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> wears off or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Fyrbryda."
5,"TEXT_BANIXA505_01513_SEQ_05","You have delivered the ceruleum tank component to Duzal Meyean. Intrigued by the differences between your creation and his own, he is confident that your continued contributions will lead to great innovations in Ixali technology."
