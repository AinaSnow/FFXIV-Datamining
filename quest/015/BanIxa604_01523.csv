The newest request from Jezul Ahuatan the Second reminds you that transaction is a web, not a chain─and every web has its spider.
※The crafting portion of this quest is recommended for Disciples of the Hand level 16 and above, and the battle portion for Disciples of War or Magic level 49 and above."
1,"TEXT_BANIXA604_01523_SEQ_01","Jezul Ahuatan has asked you to craft isolator components for the airship <Emphasis>Dezul Qualan</Emphasis>, but talk of widespread material shortage tells you that this is no matter of a short jaunt to some sutler or the other. Only an audience with Tataramu will tell.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANIXA604_01523_SEQ_02","Ever dainty as a phial of nightshade and soft-spoken in the manner of someone accustomed to being listened to, Tataramu tells you that the only materials to be had are at the Gates of Judgement in Coerthas, where an Ishgardian trader awaits his sack of gil."
3,"TEXT_BANIXA604_01523_SEQ_03","The Ishgardian trader has been met and paid, and you have had your fill of cryptic talk for the day. Think what a relief it would be to hand the materials to Norbettaux, and hear his easy chatter as he prepares the crafting facility for your use."
4,"TEXT_BANIXA604_01523_SEQ_04","With his usual deftness, Norbettaux readies the crafting facility for you. With the materials you have obtained, synthesize three high-quality isolator components, and deliver them to Jezul Ahuatan at Ehcatl.

※In the event that the status <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Facility Access: Detailing II<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> wears off or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Norbettaux."
5,"TEXT_BANIXA604_01523_SEQ_05","Such is Jezul Ahuatan's relief at taking delivery of the isolator components that you are struck anew by the burden he bears as the Second of Ehcatl. In times of unrest, all must become adventurers─and trust in one another to acquire what is so urgently needed."
