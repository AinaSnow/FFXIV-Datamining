1,"TEXT_BANIXA204_01507_SEQ_01","Methuli Cattlan has asked you to craft for her a high-quality engine casing component for the <Emphasis>Dezul Qualan</Emphasis>. As is all too often the case, however, you must first acquire the materials before you can proceed. In this instance, the carrier charged with delivering the materials has yet to arrive, and Methuli Cattlan suspects he has lost his way somewhere near the Spriggan Dig. Search for the Ehcatl Nine carrier in the Central Shroud and, with the chat mode in <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Say<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>, enter the password “High as Honor” to identify yourself as a friend.
