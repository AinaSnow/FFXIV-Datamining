Jezul Ahuatan the Second knows that where the monetary system holds no sway, barter must come into greater play.
※The crafting portion of this quest is recommended for Disciples of the Hand level 16 and above."
1,"TEXT_BANIXA602_01521_SEQ_01","Jezul Ahuatan has bamboozled you into crafting spare tank components. But first, you must reap what you have─or rather, some other botanist has─sown. The forests around Camp Dragonhead are rich in quality timber; harvest fifteen ruby spruce branches and five ruby spruce logs.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANIXA602_01521_SEQ_02","Your arms are sticky with sap, and sawdust powders your hair. Ah, to be a lumberjack and work all day! The smell of fresh-cut spruce will surely lift the spirit of even the one they call the sullen sutler."
3,"TEXT_BANIXA602_01521_SEQ_03","You have acquired a set of spare tank component materials. Present them to Norbettaux at Camp Dragonhead in order to gain access to the crafting facility under his care."
4,"TEXT_BANIXA602_01521_SEQ_04","Norbettaux has prepared the crafting facility for your use. With the materials you have obtained, synthesize two high-quality components for a spare ceruleum tank, and deliver them to Jezul Ahuatan at Ehcatl.

※In the event that the status <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Facility Access: Specialization II<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> wears off or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Norbettaux."
5,"TEXT_BANIXA602_01521_SEQ_05","Jezul Ahuatan is excessively enthused about your bout of gathering and crafting, which has been rather heavier on industry than inspiration. Your ability to complete even the most tedious of tasks is apparently a gift. Cherish it."
