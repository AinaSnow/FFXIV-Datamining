A particular school of supply chain management operates exclusively on barters, blackmail, and word of mouth, and Jezul Ahuatan the Second is an enthusiastic adherent of this philosophy.
※The crafting portion of this quest is recommended for Disciples of the Hand level 16 and above."
1,"TEXT_BANIXA601_01520_SEQ_01","Jezul Ahuatan has sweet-talked you into crafting components for escape flyers. But first, you must be the fisher of men─or of one woman, in particular. Catch three snow smelt in the Dragonhead latrines using moth pupae.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANIXA601_01520_SEQ_02","The woman you must reel in is known only as the stubborn sutler. The moniker notwithstanding, the three plump snow smelt now in your possession will surely soften her heart and persuade her to yield up the materials you need for your crafting task."
3,"TEXT_BANIXA601_01520_SEQ_03","You have taken possession of the escape flyer component materials. Present them to Norbettaux at Camp Dragonhead in order to gain access to the crafting facility under his care."
4,"TEXT_BANIXA601_01520_SEQ_04","Norbettaux has prepared the crafting facility for your use. With the materials you have obtained, synthesize a high-quality escape flyer component, and deliver it to Jezul Ahuatan at Ehcatl.

※In the event that the status <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Facility Access: Specialization II<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> wears off or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Norbettaux."
5,"TEXT_BANIXA601_01520_SEQ_05","Jezul Ahuatan squawks in excitement over the speed and sureness of your crafting. Who would have thought that your experience as a fisher would prove to be of such use in the making of escape flyers?"
