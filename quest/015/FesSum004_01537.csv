1,"TEXT_FESSUM004_01537_SEQ_01","Haermaga believes you would make a great addition to a fire–fighting event called the Rousing Douse. What exactly makes it so rousing, he would not say. You will find the answer at the Blind Iron Mines from a chaperone called Ethelia.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."

The clamor of the children grows louder; give your assent to Ethelia, mount the elbst, and commence the waterworks."
