Duzal Meyean the Steady seeks a discerning Disciple of the Hand to assist his team of crafts...birds in fixing the flaws of vital components.
※The crafting portion of this quest is recommended for Disciples of the Hand level 15 and above, and the battle portion for Disciples of War or Magic level 48 and above."
1,"TEXT_BANIXA506_01519_SEQ_01","Duzal Meyean has asked you to synthesize high-quality steering mechanism components to be installed on the <Emphasis>Dezul Qualan</Emphasis>. Proper equipment to craft these items, however, is only found at the Diamond Forge in Revenant's Toll. Speak with forgewife Fyrbryda about receiving permission to utilize the facilities.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANIXA506_01519_SEQ_02","Fyrbryda's rules for the forge are simple: one, all materials brought inside must be inspected for contraband, and two, if anyone wishes to make use of the facilities, they must first provide a generous contribution to the Revenant's Toll chapter of the Adventurers' Guild. Currently, the guild is concerned about a group of Coerthans harassing travelers who pass near Camp Revenant's Toll. Make your way to their campsite and force them to leave, by any means necessary."
3,"TEXT_BANIXA506_01519_SEQ_03","You have resolved the situation in the same way as countless ones before. Return to Fyrbryda and relay to her the good news. Also, do not forget to submit the steering mechanism component materials to the forgewife for inspection."
4,"TEXT_BANIXA506_01519_SEQ_04","Fyrbryda has granted you access to the Diamond Forge's crafting facilities. Use the materials given to you by Duzal Meyean and inspected by Fyrbryda to synthesize high-quality steering mechanism components. Once completed, return to Ehcatl with the items.

※In the event that the status <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Facility Access: Specialization<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> wears off or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Fyrbryda."
5,"TEXT_BANIXA506_01519_SEQ_05","You have delivered the steering mechanism components to Duzal Meyean. One look at your exquisite craftsmanship has made plain the error in his work, reminding him that no man─or bird─is perfect. Thanks to your efforts, the Ixal are now one step closer to completing the <Emphasis>Dezul Qualan</Emphasis>."
