Worse, in electing to install you at his son's side, the count has given Artoirel cause to believe that his father does not trust him to carry out his duties alone. Regardless, the knight means to respect Edmont's wishes, and bids you join him at the chocobo stables in Foundation, where you will secure transport to Falcon's Nest."

Happily, it seems the time has come to reclaim what was lost, and through deeds great and small, the House Durendaire knight hopes you will help to facilitate the settlement's reconstruction."
