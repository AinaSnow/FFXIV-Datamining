0,"TEXT_HEAVNA117_01596_SEQ_00","Lord Emmanellain appears to be rather pleased with himself."
1,"TEXT_HEAVNA117_01596_SEQ_01","Ever quick to see the glass half full, Lord Emmanellain has convinced himself that he should rightly be lauded for uncovering the existence of a Vanu primal. Report to Lady Laniaitte and see if she agrees."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNA117_01596_SEQ_02","Lady Laniaitte is shocked to hear that the Vanu have summoned a primal, and all agree that its presence must be behind the recent rise in Vanu hostility. Sensing his moment, Lord Emmanellain rather bluntly demands that the true hero of the hour be recognized, and for once, Lady Laniaitte agrees...and praises you for rescuing the young lord from a doom of his own making. More than satisfied with your efforts, she then invites you to return to Ishgard with Lord Haurchefant, prompting Lord Emmanellain to conclude that he too is no longer needed. Make your journey back to the city and speak with Lord Haurchefant once you have arrived."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNA117_01596_SEQ_03","Lord Haurchefant is a man who knows how to appreciate the simple pleasures in life, particularly after cheating death in battle yet again. In spite of this, he cannot help but be concerned for the welfare of Lord Emmanellain, and suggests that you visit him back at the manor."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNA117_01596_SEQ_04","For once, Lord Emmanellain is not his effervescent self, having received a dressing-down from his father for his recklessness. But will he take this lesson to heart? Only time will tell..."

49,"TEXT_HEAVNA117_01596_EMMANELLAIN_000_001","On the other hand, by risking life and limb in the line of duty, I did succeed in uncovering the existence of a new primal. And that, old <If(PlayerParameter(4))>girl<Else/>boy</If>, is no small feat!"
50,"TEXT_HEAVNA117_01596_EMMANELLAIN_000_002","I have made <Emphasis>an historic discovery</Emphasis>─a fact even Lady Laniaitte will have no choice but to acknowledge!

56,"TEXT_HEAVNA117_01596_LANIAITTE_000_012","Yet...now that I think on it, this Bismarck is reminiscent of the white whale of Vanu legend─a massive creature said to “swim” in the Sea of Clouds."
57,"TEXT_HEAVNA117_01596_HAURCHEFANT_000_013","From what I have learned of comparable summonings, the presence of the Vanu's god would certainly explain the sudden change in their behavior toward the people of Camp Cloudtop."
58,"TEXT_HEAVNA117_01596_HONOROIT_000_014","Ah, you mean to say that they have fallen under the primal's influence? I recall reading of such things in the documents provided by Master Alphinaud..."

61,"TEXT_HEAVNA117_01596_HAURCHEFANT_000_017","Well, if there is naught else to discuss, I would depart for Ishgard forthwith. The Holy See and the Temple Knights must be informed of this new threat without delay."

<If(PlayerParameter(4))>Mistress<Else/>Master</If> <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,2)/>, you have done more than enough here. Pray return to Ishgard with Lord Haurchefant and give my warmest regards to the count."

<whimper> Gods, did he have to strike me so hard?"
70,"TEXT_HEAVNA117_01596_EMMANELLAIN_000_041","Father, he...he did not approve of how I handled matters in Camp Cloudtop─how I endangered the lives of others through my own...<sniff>...recklessness and incompetence."
