1,"TEXT_HEAVNA112_01591_SEQ_01","Left to his own devices, Lord Emmanellain is likely to cause all manner of trouble─this Lady Laniaitte knows from experience. Therefore, your first course of action will be to assign him a duty which will keep him distracted for the duration of your visit. Inform the young noble that he is to keep watch for Dravanian outflyers."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNA112_01591_SEQ_02","Though disappointed that Lady Laniaitte did not see fit to tell him personally, Lord Emmanellain accepts the orders as well as can be expected. Now that you have privacy, explain to Honoroit, Lord Emmanellain's manservant, that he must ensure that the young lord stays focused on his duty."

Clearly, this is not the first time she has had to go to such lengths...and it is almost certainly not the last."
