2,"TEXT_SUBPST013_01573_SEQ_02","The man thought to be the renowned aesthetician Jandelaine was in fact his brother, a staid youth by the name of Guillefresne. He informs you that he, in fact, is the author of the missive you carry, explaining that he has traveled from Ishgard to convince his brother to return home and succeed their stricken father as lord of the family domain. Hearing from the chatty madam that Jandelaine has gone to procure a new comb, Guillefresne sets out for the Carpenters' Guild in Gridania. Pursue the youth and speak with Master Beatin."

Guillefresne confronts his brother, strongly insisting that the aesthetician abandon his profession and return to the family lands in Ishgard. Jandelaine responds with a flourish of his blades, giving his timid brother stately locks that instill him with newfound confidence and resolve. Now enlightened as to the true callings of both sibling and self, the reborn Guillefresne swears to do his family proud before bidding both you and his brother farewell."
