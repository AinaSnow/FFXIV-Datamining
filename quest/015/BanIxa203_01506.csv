An unforeseen delay has given Methuli Cattlan the Hard cause for concern.
※The crafting portion of this quest is recommended for Disciples of the Hand level 3 and above, and the battle portion for Disciples of War or Magic level 43 and above."
1,"TEXT_BANIXA203_01506_SEQ_01","Methuli Cattlan has asked you to craft for her a high-quality deck component for the <Emphasis>Dezul Qualan</Emphasis>. However, before you can do so, you must obtain the requisite materials from a shale golem, which can be lured out of hiding by slaying clay golems in Alder Springs. If you have difficulty defeating the shale golem, you can use the dissolving agent provided by Methuli Cattlan to weaken it.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANIXA203_01506_SEQ_02","You have reclaimed the deck component materials. Present them to Hildeyerd at the Bobbing Cork in order to gain access to the crafting facility under her care."
3,"TEXT_BANIXA203_01506_SEQ_03","Hildeyerd has prepared the crafting facility for your use. With the materials you have obtained, synthesize a high-quality deck component, and deliver it to Methuli Cattlan at Ehcatl.

※In the event that the status <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Facility Access: Detailing<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> wears off or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Hildeyerd."
4,"TEXT_BANIXA203_01506_SEQ_04","You deliver the deck component to Methuli Cattlan, who is impressed by your aptitude for both crafting and combat. Indeed, to survive in a land like Eorzea, filled with fearsome fauna, an adventurer is wise to master many skills."
