1,"TEXT_HEAVNA113_01592_SEQ_01","Instead of listening to her expound at greater length, Lady Laniaitte would rather have you gain firsthand experience of the Vanu Vanu. To that end, she sends you to speak with Ser Marielle, who could use your assistance."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNA113_01592_SEQ_02","Though Ser Marielle describes the Vanu as birdmen, she is quick to clarify that they are nothing like the Ixal. She marks several locations on your map and bids you stand watch in case the Vanu are nearby."
