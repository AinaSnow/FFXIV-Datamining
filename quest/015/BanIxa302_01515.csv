1,"TEXT_BANIXA302_01515_SEQ_01","Moderately satisfied with your work on previous <Emphasis>Dezul Qualan</Emphasis> components, Rozol Cattlan the Prudent wishes you to focus your efforts on crafting parts for the cockpit interior. Materials for these components have already been delivered part of the way to the Observatorium, and you need only collect them from the Ehcatl Nine carrier waiting at Skyfire Locks.

Also, speak with Roiteloin of the Locks and ask if he has any pine lumber scraps (with which to bribe Templeton, of course).

Use the materials given to you by the Ehcatl Nine carrier and inspected by Templeton to synthesize two high-quality cockpit interior components, and deliver the finished products to the faction.

As construction on the <Emphasis>Dezul Qualan</Emphasis> continues, the Ehcatl Nine are coming to the realization that they may have never made it this far along if it were not for the industriousness of their featherless collaborators."
