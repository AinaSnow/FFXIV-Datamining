Carry the contract drafted by Gegeruju to this esteemed personage, who may be found in outer La Noscea."

Deeply moved to have found a patron who would pay the proper respect to his people's tradition, Bugaal Ja eagerly consents to the terms offered. Before setting off for Costa del Sol, however, he must prepare himself according to Mamool Ja custom. Seek him out at the Hermit's Hovel."

Nevertheless, it appears that it will still be some time before the average Eorzean can find it in himself to accept Mamool Ja custom. In the meantime, should the undulations of the erstwhile dancing master once more threaten to cause panic amongst the unwitting bath-goers of Bronze Lake, you know where your talents will be needed."
