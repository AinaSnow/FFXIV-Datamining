Duzal Meyean the Steady seeks a dedicated Disciple of the Hand to assist his team of crafts...birds in the creation of durable components.
※The crafting portion of this quest is recommended for Disciples of the Hand level 15 and above."
1,"TEXT_BANIXA503_01511_SEQ_01","Duzal Meyean has asked you to synthesize components for the exhaust outlets to be opened on the <Emphasis>Dezul Qualan</Emphasis>. Proper equipment to craft these items, however, is only found at the Diamond Forge in Revenant's Toll. Speak with forgewife Fyrbryda about receiving permission to utilize the facilities.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level."
2,"TEXT_BANIXA503_01511_SEQ_02","Fyrbryda's rules for the forge are simple: one, all materials brought inside must be inspected for contraband, and two, if anyone wishes to make use of the facilities, they must first provide a generous contribution to the Revenant's Toll chapter of the Adventurers' Guild. The forgewife believes that fifteen clear water shards and five clear water clusters should suffice. Why the Adventurers' Guild would need something obviously more suited for use in, say, a forge, is probably best left unspoken."
3,"TEXT_BANIXA503_01511_SEQ_03","You have collected a sufficient number of shards and clusters. Return them to Fyrbryda immediately before the Adventurers' Guild is forced to shutter its doors due to a crystal shortage. Also, do not forget to submit the exhaust outlet component materials to the forgewife for inspection."
4,"TEXT_BANIXA503_01511_SEQ_04","Fyrbryda has granted you access to the Diamond Forge's crafting facilities. Use the materials given to you by Duzal Meyean and inspected by Fyrbryda to synthesize a high-quality exhaust outlet component. Once completed, return to Ehcatl with the item.

※In the event that the status <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Facility Access: Specialization<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> wears off or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Fyrbryda."
5,"TEXT_BANIXA503_01511_SEQ_05","You have delivered the exhaust outlet component to Duzal Meyean. The veteran is reassured to find your attention to detail mirrors his own and commends you on your never-ending pursuit of perfection."
