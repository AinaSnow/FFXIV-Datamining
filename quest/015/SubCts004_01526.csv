Following a lesson in maritime history and natural phenomena, the man tasks you with going to Hullbreaker Isle in order to retrieve a golden coffer which belonged to the pirate king Mistbeard. See to your preparations, then speak with Denston at the Moraby Drydocks to be ferried over to the isle."

The storm marshal unlocks the coffer to produce a mask bearing a menacing visage, which he explains has been worn by all the individuals who have borne the name Mistbeard. The legendary pirate, it would seem, is not one man, but many. Eynzahr goes on to say that the current Mistbeard will be the last, having chosen to consign himself and his predecessors to the pages of history─all for the sake of one woman and her dream of a brighter future for Limsa Lominsa..."
