2,"TEXT_CLSGLD700_02603_SEQ_02","The apprentices reveal that they have already begun work on the orchestrion in secret, and they would like you and Emeloth to inspect the components they have each crafted. Take the three items to your deputy and have her assess their quality."

While she believes they are capable of handling the rest themselves, she can appreciate the sentimental value in entrusting the finishing touches to you. See to this task and present Emeloth with the completed orchestrion.

※In the event you lose the materials or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Kanchana."

The gift is ready; all that remains is the giving of it, and Emeloth promises to arrange an audience with Nanamo. Go to the palace entrance on the Royal Promenade at the appointed hour, and make yourself known to the sultansworn Bartholomew."
5,"TEXT_CLSGLD700_02603_SEQ_05","You present the orchestrion to Nanamo, who is beside herself with delight. For in its elegant yet compact form she sees not only the object of her desire, but also the promise of a brighter future for Ala Mhigo. The audience thus happily concluded, Emeloth bids the members of the Crown Gemworks gather at the Goldsmiths' Guild."
6,"TEXT_CLSGLD700_02603_SEQ_06","Marcel arrives with the news that the knowledge of your gift to the sultana has swiftly gone public, and orders for identical orchestrions have since flooded Eshtaime's Aesthetics. Serendipity confesses to having told Momodi, an act tantamount to telling the whole of Ul'dah, but Marcel takes these developments in his stride and extends a supply deal to the apprentices─now apprentices no more. So it is that your role in their tale comes to an end. Yet near or far, you shall ever be their schoolmaster, and for the betterment of your art, see to it that you continue to blaze new trails as a goldsmith."
