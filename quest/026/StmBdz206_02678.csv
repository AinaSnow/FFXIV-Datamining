50,"TEXT_STMBDZ206_02678_HAYAMA_000_002","I know what you are thinking. He is a pirate, so why should I care? Indeed, normally I would not. He is, however, a boy before a pirate and I cannot in good conscience turn a blind eye to a child in danger."
51,"TEXT_STMBDZ206_02678_HAYAMA_000_003","In informing you of his plight, however, I have already done my part. Whether the boy lives or not is now up to you."

54,"TEXT_STMBDZ206_02678_LITTLEPIRATES_000_011","Don't you get it? I was not being chased, rather I was attempting to lure them into this trap. As soon as they got close to these firecrackers─BAM! They were as good as dead."
55,"TEXT_STMBDZ206_02678_LITTLEPIRATES_000_012","Now because of you, I have to start all over again! <sigh> Could you at least go and tell the pirate watching me from up there that I will be late to return?"
56,"TEXT_STMBDZ206_02678_PIRATES_000_020","Aye, friend. I saw everything─you rescued our boy. Thank you for that."
