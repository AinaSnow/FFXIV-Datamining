Your assistance is greatly appreciated. The drones were not in our possession for very long, but a cursory inspection showed they are made with a heretofore unknown metal alloy."

60,"TEXT_STMBDZ005_02639_LOEZKIRZ_000_022","I only pray that isn't to our detriment in the future. There's still plenty more of those drones out there along Baelsar's Wall. If any more of them should suddenly stir..."
