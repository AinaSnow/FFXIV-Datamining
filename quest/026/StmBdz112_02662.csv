1,"TEXT_STMBDZ112_02662_SEQ_01","The lieutenant is back on her feet, and ready to continue the investigation. She means to leave no stone unturned, and suggests splitting up to cover more ground."
2,"TEXT_STMBDZ112_02662_SEQ_02","Upon investigating the buildings, you notice they are suspiciously clean, and the ground surrounding them is littered with fresh footprints. Perhaps Lieutenant Molkoh has found more concrete evidence of what happened in Bittermill."
3,"TEXT_STMBDZ112_02662_SEQ_03","You find the lieutenant in the company of a peculiar man who seems bereft of his memories. He can recall nothing, not even his own identity. The only thing he is certain of is a tenuous connection he has with Bittermill. Suspecting he is one of the missing prisoners, Lieutenant Molkoh convinces him to accompany you both back to Castrum Oriens."
4,"TEXT_STMBDZ112_02662_SEQ_04","Serpent Marshal Brookstone is pleased with this sudden turn of events, quickly sending Lieutenant Molkoh off to provide their new detainee with a hot meal, after which he is to be questioned. The serpent marshal bids you wait with him until the interrogation has finished."

58,"TEXT_STMBDZ112_02662_TAHLAMOLKOH_000_023","Wh-What? You have some nerve. Regardless of how I look, I am a ranking officer of the Order of the Twin Adder, thank you very much. Now who are you, and what business do you have here?"

66,"TEXT_STMBDZ112_02662_TAHLAMOLKOH_000_031","Alright then. Let's return to Castrum Oriens. <sigh> My browbeating commander will likely wish to meet you. I suppose it can't be helped."

I expected such wild claims from Lieutenant Molkoh, but if you would corroborate her report, perhaps this warrants investigation. Until further notice, he shall stay under the protection of the Eorzean Alliance."

70,"TEXT_STMBDZ112_02662_SWETHRYKBROOKSTONE_000_042","Lieutenant Molkoh. Get this man a hot meal and a warm bed. When he's had a bit of rest, see what he knows of Bittermill and the Garleans."
71,"TEXT_STMBDZ112_02662_SWETHRYKBROOKSTONE_000_043","It should not be long before we reach a resolution to all this. You're free to wait here until she finishes questioning our new detainee."
