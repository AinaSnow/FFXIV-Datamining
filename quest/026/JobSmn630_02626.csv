121,"TEXT_JOBSMN630_02626_YMHITRA_000_571","From our research, we have learned that summoners were initially lauded as heroes for their success against the primals.

125,"TEXT_JOBSMN630_02626_PRINCIPIA_000_575","My creator was well versed in aetherochemistry and held a particular interest in the technology of information. Broadly speaking, he researched methods for producing arcane geometries without grimoires, and experimented with machine-enhanced egi."

129,"TEXT_JOBSMN630_02626_PRINCIPIA_000_579","I was shut in a storeroom─abandoned to my slumber like some common treatise on trade agreements in the southern provinces─and thus I can tell you naught of what befell my creator in his later years."
