2,"TEXT_STMBDZ217_02689_SEQ_02","The ship Kikimo has come on is too small to transport all the Confederacy goods back to Kugane. As such, she must return once to the port city and bring back a larger vessel. Tsukikage suggests meeting at the far north of Sakazuki to ensure the transaction goes through smoothly. To prepare for her arrival, he would have Hansaku clear the northern area of wild beasts while Suzume rests at the guardroom to recover from her pearl-diving injuries and he and you see that the goods make it safely to the other side of the island."
3,"TEXT_STMBDZ217_02689_SEQ_03","As Tsukikage is having his men load up the goods to transport them to the other side of the island, he notices that one of the items is missing─the crimson-shell ring. He suspects it has been stolen and would like for you to fetch Suzume that she might assist him in tracking down the thief.

5,"TEXT_STMBDZ217_02689_SEQ_05","Upon rechecking the inventory list, Tsukikage realizes the crimson-shell ring that went missing had been made by Suzume's parents. He suspects the fake merchants they tossed into the sea may have had a hand in the village raid that led to her parents' deaths. Knowing that Hansaku was once involved with them, Tsukikage reasons Suzume has gone to Hells' Lid not to help him but to get revenge."
