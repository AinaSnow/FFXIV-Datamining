1,"TEXT_CLSCUL700_02608_SEQ_01","After pondering Unzan's words on the purity of Far Eastern cuisine at length, Raulf has identified the reason why the claim sits ill with him. He recounts to you the very first Far Eastern dish he ever had, which Anzu made for him: sukiyaki, a hearty dish of meat and vegetables simmered in a shallow pot. The taste of it unearthed long-buried memories of an identical stew from his childhood in Ala Mhigo, and he believes that there is a connection between the two. In order to verify his theory, Raulf sets forth for the village of Ala Ghiri in the Peaks region; join him there if you would help him in his quest."
2,"TEXT_CLSCUL700_02608_SEQ_02","Raulf is grateful for your continued cooperation. He bids you split up and ask the denizens of Ala Ghiri about the stew from his memory."

4,"TEXT_CLSCUL700_02608_SEQ_04","Raulf is certain that buckler stew was the dish from his childhood, and all that remains is to establish a connection with sukiyaki. To this end, Raulf has tracked down an individual who is versed in history. Seek out this individual and ask him what he knows."
5,"TEXT_CLSCUL700_02608_SEQ_05","According to the Highlander historian, Ala Mhigo traded only as far as the Near East and had no direct dealings with Far Eastern states. However, Raulf is not ready to give up, and posits that Radz–at–Han may have been a waypoint for trade─and the dish. By a stroke of good fortune, it appears Ala Ghiri is home to a Hannish immigrant who came to Eorzea many years ago. Join Raulf as he searches for the elderly fellow outside the village."
6,"TEXT_CLSCUL700_02608_SEQ_06","In the course of your search, you hear an elderly man crying out for help. Make haste after Raulf in the direction of the voice."
7,"TEXT_CLSCUL700_02608_SEQ_07","You arrive at the scene to find Raulf spent but alive, Qiqirn bandits dead at his feet. The elderly fellow he saved turns out to be the Hannish immigrant, and as luck would have it, he is extremely fond of buckler stew. He confirms that the dish first came from Ala Mhigo to Radz–at–Han, and thence made its way to Doma, where it was reborn as sukiyaki. Raulf will remain in Ala Ghiri awhile to learn the recipe for buckler stew, and promises to meet you back at Revenant's Toll when he is done."
8,"TEXT_CLSCUL700_02608_SEQ_08","In a rare display of kindness from Rowena, Raulf has secured the use of his old kitchen for his bid to win Unzan over. For a final favor, he asks that you prepare a serving of Doman sukiyaki for him. Raulf's future with Anzu and as a culinarian both hang in the balance; see that you make the best example of the dish you are able.

※In the event you lose the ingredients or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Popin."
9,"TEXT_CLSCUL700_02608_SEQ_09","You present your Doman sukiyaki to Raulf just as he finishes making his buckler stew. The two dishes are placed before Unzan and Anzu, who are shocked to find that, despite their apparent differences, they taste almost identical. Raulf proceeds to explain how the Ala Mhigan buckler stew was reborn in Doma as sukiyaki, its arrival giving rise to new possibilities in Far Eastern cuisine. A moment passes in tense silence before Unzan invites Raulf to join the meal─as family should. At the conclusion of the happy gathering, Raulf offers you his heartfelt thanks for helping him to win over Unzan, with whose blessing he and Anzu will wed at the earliest opportunity. He then declares that he will hang up his adventurer's hat for good and resume his post at the café, serving Far Eastern dishes. As your brother culinarian finds his place, continue carving your own path and ever strive towards new horizons."
