68,"TEXT_STMBDZ010_02644_QUINCOMPAIX_000_030","Wonderful. Simply wonderful. I should also mention, the strangest thing happened while you were away─a few of the men came by to speak with me about our provisions. Your asking about camp likely spurred them to action."
69,"TEXT_STMBDZ010_02644_QUINCOMPAIX_000_031","Now that we better understand their grievances, we plan to take better care to supply the men with cooking palatable to more than just us Gridanians."
