60,"TEXT_STMBDZ213_02685_YANA_000_051","It is said these beasts are the souls of men and women who died at sea. In never having been buried, they are unable to find closure and remain upon this earth, poisoning the souls of the living with their noxious breath."
61,"TEXT_STMBDZ213_02685_YANA_000_052","Perhaps the people of Koshu never learned the tale, and that is why our new batch of underlings did not have the sense to run when they saw the creature."
