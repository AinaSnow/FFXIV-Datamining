1,"TEXT_STMBDZ111_02661_SEQ_01","The Alliance has recently taken hold of Castrum Oriens, and Serpent Marshal Brookstone is preparing for a reconnaissance of the area. He asks for your assistance, bidding you speak with Lieutenant Molkoh for further details."
2,"TEXT_STMBDZ111_02661_SEQ_02","Lieutenant Molkoh seems more than excited to be in your presence. After regaining her composure, she explains to you the purpose of the mission. They have discovered records of Ala Mhigan prisoners dating back to the beginning of the Garlean occupation twenty years prior. However, a number of entries in the documents are listed only as “Whereabouts Unknown.” To begin your investigation into these missing prisoners, Lieutenant Molkoh suggests speaking with the Ananta, whose residency in the Fringes predates even the Ala Mhigans."
3,"TEXT_STMBDZ111_02661_SEQ_03","You speak with an Ananta battlemaid who recalls the Garleans making prisoners of everyone they encountered, be they Ala Mhigan or even Ananta. While most were forced to serve in the imperial armies, a number of people were also taken to Bittermill. Lieutenant Molkoh now hopes to find some link to the past in the ruin of the abandoned hamlet."
4,"TEXT_STMBDZ111_02661_SEQ_04","No sooner do you arrive than you find Lieutenant Molkoh being assaulted by three Garlean soldiers. You make short work of two of her assailants. Perhaps you can pry answers out of the third."
5,"TEXT_STMBDZ111_02661_SEQ_05","The remaining soldier's eyes grow wide with fright at the sight of his fallen comrades and he soon flees. Lieutenant Molkoh seems to be injured, but hopefully her wounds are not serious."
6,"TEXT_STMBDZ111_02661_SEQ_06","Lieutenant Molkoh is none the worse for wear, but she is perplexed by the presence of Garlean soldiers. She suspects something suspicious is afoot. Before you can proceed, however, she begs you a moment to rest."

57,"TEXT_STMBDZ111_02661_TAHLAMOLKOH_000_015","Now then, let me apprise you of our current situation. Shortly after taking control of Castrum Oriens, we discovered a number of confidential documents left behind by the Garleans─prisoner records dating back to the beginning of Ala Mhigo's occupation."
58,"TEXT_STMBDZ111_02661_TAHLAMOLKOH_000_016","As you might have guessed, a great many were conscripted and sent away to subjugate new territories. A surprisingly large number were executed, as a reminder of what would happen should any step out of line."
59,"TEXT_STMBDZ111_02661_TAHLAMOLKOH_000_017","What we weren't expecting, however, was a number of prisoners listed simply as “Whereabouts Unknown.” We thought perhaps they met some ill-fortune during their imprisonment, or even escaped, but we could find no other documents to suggest what became of them."
60,"TEXT_STMBDZ111_02661_TAHLAMOLKOH_000_018","Be they living or deceased, it is now our duty to find them. Not just for our own records, mind you, but their loved ones as well. They deserve the peace of mind of knowing what happened here."
61,"TEXT_STMBDZ111_02661_TAHLAMOLKOH_000_019","Would that this were a recent incident, though. It will be no easy task ascertaining their whereabouts after twenty years, but I believe I know where we might begin our investigation."
62,"TEXT_STMBDZ111_02661_TAHLAMOLKOH_000_020","The Ananta have called these lands home long before even the Ala Mhigans came to settle here. And as luck would have it, the Resistance has established cordial relations with their people. Perhaps they remember something of what happened all those years ago."

83,"TEXT_STMBDZ111_02661_TAHLAMOLKOH_000_051","Garlean soldiers were certainly the last thing I expected to find in these abandoned and otherwise forgotten buildings. I managed to catch them unawares, but I'm quite certain this investigation would have ended poorly had you not arrived."
