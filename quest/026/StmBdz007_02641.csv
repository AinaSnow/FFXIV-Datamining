49,"TEXT_STMBDZ007_02641_MAELSTROM02641_000_001","Three of our prisoners escaped from their cells during the guard change last night. Thankfully, scouts from the Twin Adders have already ascertained their location."
50,"TEXT_STMBDZ007_02641_MAELSTROM02641_000_002","They don't seem to have noticed they were being followed, and if the fates are kind, we can take them unawares."

52,"TEXT_STMBDZ007_02641_MAELSTROM02641_000_004","The prisoners were last spotted heading toward a cave along the Velodyna River. Let us hurry, while we still have the element of surprise."

54,"TEXT_STMBDZ007_02641_MAELSTROM02641_000_011","It seems the one caught by surprise was me. I was ambushed before I could even step foot near the cave."

58,"TEXT_STMBDZ007_02641_MAELSTROM02641_000_021","What's more, they claim to have laid markers along the river to warn us. The problem, however, is these markers are unfamiliar to any save the Twin Adders, lest their enemies realize what they are."
59,"TEXT_STMBDZ007_02641_MAELSTROM02641_000_022","It has become painfully clear that there is still much to be done if the Grand Companies are to function together as a single, cohesive unit. We cannot assume that one company is familiar with the stratagems of another."
