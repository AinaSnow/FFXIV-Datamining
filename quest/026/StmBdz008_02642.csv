Go on, tell <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If> what you told me."
51,"TEXT_STMBDZ008_02642_YOUNGSOLDIER02642_000_011","R-Right. I was making my rounds, as I always do, when I was assaulted by a group of giant spiders! I panicked and ran, but in my haste I dropped my satchel, which contained a rather important set of documents."
52,"TEXT_STMBDZ008_02642_YOUNGSOLDIER02642_000_012","I came back here to retrieve them, but...the spiders... <shudder> They took the bag and went down into that rather large hole over there. I meant to go after them, but I considered having to fight them off in the dark, and soon thought better of it."
53,"TEXT_STMBDZ008_02642_OLDSOLDIER02642_000_013","I think I know how to flush 'em out. They don't take too kindly to loud noises. Here, take a few o' these firecrackers an' toss 'em down there."

65,"TEXT_STMBDZ008_02642_OLDSOLDIER02642_000_032","Ahem. Well, there's no need to rush. It's been a long day, an' I'm sure the satchel's not goin' anywhere. For now let's head back to Castrum Oriens where I can give you proper thanks."

68,"TEXT_STMBDZ008_02642_OLDSOLDIER02642_000_041","You see, this isn't the first time I've dealt with those spiders. I was born an' raised in these parts, an' I've hunted more than my fair share o' those eight-legged nightmares in my time. It's why I knew to use those firecrackers."
69,"TEXT_STMBDZ008_02642_OLDSOLDIER02642_000_042","East End used to be teemin' with 'em, an' I thought we'd wiped 'em all out. <sigh> Apparently not..."
