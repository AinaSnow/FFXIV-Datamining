1,"TEXT_LUCKSA051_03845_SEQ_01","At the mention of forging additional resistance weapons, Zlatan's expression turns to one of staggering guilt. Knowing their coffers cannot bear the weight of additional debt, he accedes to your request on the condition that you procure the required powder. How the deed is to be done, he leaves entirely to your discretion."
2,"TEXT_LUCKSA051_03845_SEQ_02","Through means perhaps better left unspoken, you acquire the requisite powder for Gerolt's work. Newly armed, he bids you set out into the world and hone your skills with this newly fashioned resistance weapon. And when the time comes, he will help you to reach new heights of martial perfection."
