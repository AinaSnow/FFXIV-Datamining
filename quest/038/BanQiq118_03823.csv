50,"TEXT_BANQIQ118_03823_UTERLMATL_000_010","Greetings, my good <If(PlayerParameter(4))>madam<Else/>sir</If>! I take it you are here at Qhoterl Pasol's request, yes? The truth is, we have uncovered a rather bizarre artifact in the deeper levels of the cavern. An urn, but one like no other."
51,"TEXT_BANQIQ118_03823_UTERLMATL_000_011","For inside was, for want of a more grandiose word, a whistle. Or perhaps it was a flute... Whatever it is, one brave soul took it and played a brief melody, and a moment later, something appeared within the otherwise empty vessel: the great serpent itself!"
52,"TEXT_BANQIQ118_03823_UTERLMATL_000_012","Why, I could hardly believe my eyes, but what happened next was perhaps even more miraculous. Our divine visitor did release a heavenly light, and those who did receive of this blessing were as Qitari reborn, filled with vigor! Now, listen carefully..."

Sometimes, it'll wiggle. Other times, it'll bob up and down and let out a mighty “scree!” Yes, we are truly blessed."
