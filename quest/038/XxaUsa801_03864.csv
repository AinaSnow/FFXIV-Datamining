1,"TEXT_XXAUSA801_03864_SEQ_01","It is popularly believed that the local ziz may be responsible for the deaths. Aideen suggests that you cull three of the scalekin to see whether you can find any clues."
2,"TEXT_XXAUSA801_03864_SEQ_02","You have culled three ziz as suggested, and have little to show for it besides a rich crop of bites and gashes. Return to Fallgourd Float and report to Aideen."
3,"TEXT_XXAUSA801_03864_SEQ_03","Aideen strikes ziz from her list of suspects, and turns her attention once more towards the masked man and his winged eyeball."
