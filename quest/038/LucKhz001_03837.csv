50,"TEXT_LUCKHZ001_03837_EHLLTOU_000_002","If I'm to do this, I must know historical events as if I've lived them. To that end, I would meet the great person who put an end to the Dragonsong War. Do you know where I might find this individual?"
51,"TEXT_LUCKHZ001_03837_EHLLTOU_000_003","...What? You are that great person? Heh, all this time I thought “hero” was your name!"
52,"TEXT_LUCKHZ001_03837_EHLLTOU_000_004","In any case, this makes things simpler. I want you to show me the key places where the war unfolded, and tell me tales about them!"

56,"TEXT_LUCKHZ001_03837_EHLLTOU_000_020","So this is the Vault, where the most wicked of men once resided... Vidofnir told us of the time she rescued a child who was thrown off the top."

69,"TEXT_LUCKHZ001_03837_EHLLTOU_000_040","So that is the relief... I've seen the artworks of men before, but I find it such a peculiar way to express one's feelings. Still, you can't be faulted for your artistry."
70,"TEXT_LUCKHZ001_03837_EHLLTOU_000_041","But grand as it looks, the scent of sadness clings to it. The scent of blood. Vidofnir's, and others'..."

77,"TEXT_LUCKHZ001_03837_EHLLTOU_000_052","Of course, this is just the beginning. If my songs are to be as resplendent as Ratatoskr's, I must learn more about men and their culture."

83,"TEXT_LUCKHZ001_03837_HAUTDLONG_000_057","You see, it's my dream to become a writer. Not just any writer, but one who chronicles this new age of peace between man and dragon. So please, won't you allow me to assist you?"
