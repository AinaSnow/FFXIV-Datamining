1,"TEXT_XXAUSE106_03876_SEQ_01","Alphinaud's efforts having proved successful, the Scions have secured a new location for their headquarters: Revenant's Toll in Mor Dhona. Minfilia would begin preparations for the move immediately, as there is much that still must be done. Pay visit to her and see if there is aught you might do to be of service."
2,"TEXT_XXAUSE106_03876_SEQ_02","Minfilia has entrusted you with a number of documents pertaining to the forthcoming move to Mor Dhona. You are to deliver them to Slafborn at Revenant's Toll, in accordance with the agreement between the Scions and the Adventurers' Guild."
3,"TEXT_XXAUSE106_03876_SEQ_03","Slafborn is pleased that you were the Scion chosen to represent the order in Revenant's Toll, and waggishly declares that he intends to impose the work of a dozen men upon you, though he subsequently claims to be jesting. At any rate, it would appear the Scions' long-awaited relocation effort can finally begin in earnest."
