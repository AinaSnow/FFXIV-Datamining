※Changing classes or jobs will prevent progress during this quest."
1,"TEXT_LUCKSA050_03844_SEQ_01","Thanks to your efforts and Cid's cooperation, everything is in place to begin reforging the blades of Gunnhildr, arms Gerolt would now refer to as resistance weapons. Before setting to work, however, Gerolt asks you to expound on your exploration of Cid's mind. This insight makes clear to him that the weapons require a final ingredient before they can be completed─a special powder highly conductive to aether. Much to his dismay, the one best suited to acquiring this for you is none other than Rowena. At the risk of incurring more debt, he asks you to meet with her in Kugane to make an arrangement on behalf of the Bozjan resistance.

※You may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_LUCKSA050_03844_SEQ_02","Rowena has heard the details of your predicament from Gerolt, and is willing to provide you with the powder you require. It will, however, come at a cost to the Bozjan resistance. You are unsure of what this means for Bajsaljen and his comrades, but the deal is struck nevertheless. With matters settled in Kugane, you return to Gangos, eager to see the fruits of Gerolt's labor."
3,"TEXT_LUCKSA050_03844_SEQ_03","Though you are too late to behold the masterful strikes of Gerolt's hammer on his anvil, you are fortunate enough to witness the final touches to the inscription. Armed as one of Gunnhildr's elite guard, you will soon be ready to help liberate the people of Bozja."

80,"TEXT_LUCKSA050_03844_ROWENA_000_075","Same goes for you. I know you adventurin' types are always lookin' to be prepared for any sort of encounter, so if you're thinkin' of forgin' another of these resistance weapons─and I suspect you are─you know where to go."
