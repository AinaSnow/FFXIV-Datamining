1,"TEXT_LUCKHT002_03849_SEQ_01","Neillemard explains that he would like you to begin by augmenting your Skysteel prototype twice. To do so, you must provide Denys with a sufficiency of materials crafted or gathered using the aforementioned prototype itself. With luck, the result will be a honed and tested tool that will meet with Nimie's approval."
2,"TEXT_LUCKHT002_03849_SEQ_02","After handing over a rather hefty quantity of materials twice over, you at last are in the position to show your new dragonsung tool to Nimie. All of the Skysteel engineers seem quite pleased with the outcome, and are eager to alter their plans for future versions of the tool that it might continue on its path toward perfection─though it seems said adjustments will take some time."
