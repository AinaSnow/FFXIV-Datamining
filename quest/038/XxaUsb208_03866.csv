Before you can face the Lord of Crags in battle, you must procure a bottle of the very finest wine from Shamani Lohmani, a former member of the Company. Wheiskaet hands you a note to explain the details of the order, which should save you the trouble of remembering any difficult-to-pronounce wine names."
