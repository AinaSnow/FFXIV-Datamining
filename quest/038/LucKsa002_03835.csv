3,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_SEQ_03","No sooner do you arrive at the resistance camp than you find yourself face-to-face with Bajsaljen, leader of the Bozjan resistance. He and his comrades explain to you their plan─to reforge the legendary weapons of Gunnhildr's Blades. Despite the scarcity of recordings relating to Queen Gunnhildr and her guard, they have made great strides in reproducing their vaunted arms. The key to their completion is a holy inscription engraved upon them, any traces of which were lost when Bozja Citadel fell many years ago. For their plans to move forward, they have enlisted the aid of an old friend─Mikoto."
4,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_SEQ_04","In perhaps a few too many words, and a demonstration assisted by Gerolt, Mikoto expounds further on their plans. Borrowing the long-forgotten techniques of Bozjan seers, you must use a special crystal focus to enter the memories of those who may have seen the holy inscription required to reforge Gunnhildr's weapons. The problem, however, is that anyone who had glimpsed the inscription perished when Bozja Citadel was destroyed. Or so they thought. While contemplating the possibility of survivors, Mikoto is struck by a vision of the future. In it, she sees Cid Garlond, convincing her that he is the eyewitness you are searching for."

Thankfully, Jessie happens to overhear your conversation and clears up any misconceptions regarding his present commitments. Before taking her leave, Jessie asks that you proceed with caution, fearful of what horrors may be unearthed from Cid's past."

317,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MIKOTO_300_401","Were one to be possessed of only corporeal aether, they would be but a walking corpse.

Of course, a ghost that possesses residual memories could likely recall its past and retain self-awareness."
318,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MIKOTO_300_402","Using a crystal focus, we can isolate the aetherial signature of memories, much in the same way the seers did. We can then delve into and explore specific memories conjured by the subject."

320,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MIKOTO_300_404","That is why it is important to mark the distinction between explicit and implicit memories."
321,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MIKOTO_300_405","Explicit memories are those consciously stored and recalled, while implicit memories are more passively accumulated by our subconscious."
322,"TEXT_LUCKSA002_03835_MIKOTO_300_406","When meeting someone for the first time, their appearance will be kept as part of our explicit memory, though this may fade with the passing of time. Should a great deal of time pass without meeting, however, such recollection can prove difficult."
