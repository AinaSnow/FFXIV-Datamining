※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESEST601_03846_SEQ_01","In Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre, you come upon Jihli Aliapoh, who regales you with the history of the event known as Hatching–tide─a festival born of her vision of the Twelve Archons of the Sixth Umbral Era. As she tells it, this year she was blessed with another vision: this one not of storied heroes, but of fluffy rabbits─which may in part explain her curious appearance. Though what she has in mind is not immediately clear, one thing is: she requires your aid to make the festival a success. Should you be inclined to lend your assistance, seek out her colleague Nonotta by the Carline Canopy and see what you might do on the celebrants' behalf.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESEST601_03846_SEQ_02","You find Nonotta, herself curiously dressed as an oversized hare, who is all too eager to share with you her plight. To wit, a veritable legion of chickens painstakingly procured by her and Jihli have flown the coop, placing their meticulous plans for this year's festivities in peril. Put your hen-hunting skills to the test and go forth to recover these exceptional egg-laying specimens, that the celebration might not meet a premature demise."
3,"TEXT_FESEST601_03846_SEQ_03","After a hair-raising, feather-ruffling encounter, you succeed in tracking down the chickens as per Nonotta's request. Report back to your client and let her know that the deed is done."
4,"TEXT_FESEST601_03846_SEQ_04","Nonotta rejoices that you have successfully tracked down all of her lost chickens and led them back to the coop. She bids you join her back at Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre, where you might share the news of your triumph with her compatriot Jihli Aliapoh."
5,"TEXT_FESEST601_03846_SEQ_05","Back at the amphitheatre, Jihli rejoices upon hearing that the chickens have been returned, allowing Hatching–tide to begin in earnest. After Nonotta takes her leave, Jihli informs you in secret that she believes you to be the key to the success of this year's festivities. If you feel so inclined, wait around and offer your aid when the time is right."

54,"TEXT_FESEST601_03846_JIHLIALIAPOH_000_007","(-Jihli Aliapoh-)From atop their giant, decorated eggs they called to me: “Arise, young Dreamer, and make ready the vessels for our return.” When I awoke, I quickly set about filling the realm with all manner of painted ovoids.

55,"TEXT_FESEST601_03846_JIHLIALIAPOH_000_008","(-Jihli Aliapoh-)And before you ask─yes, this costume is the result of yet another vision.

56,"TEXT_FESEST601_03846_JIHLIALIAPOH_000_009","(-Jihli Aliapoh-)“Why rabbits?” you may ask, and the question is a valid one. After all, rabbits do not lay eggs, nor are they traditionally associated with the Archons in any particular way."
