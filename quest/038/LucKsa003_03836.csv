286,"TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_MIKOTO_300_303","Which then begs the question: who were the seers, and whence did they come? This is but a working theory, but I suspect their roots can be traced back to the Allagans themselves─perhaps survivors of the Fourth Umbral Calamity who wished to atone for the sins of their forebears."
287,"TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_MIKOTO_300_304","They came to these lands seeking a means to help the Bozjans, and in doing so created these crystal foci."
288,"TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_MIKOTO_300_305","...Ahem. As I said, 'tis but a working theory. Though I understand if it sounds more like a flight of fancy."
289,"TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_MIKOTO_300_400","Perhaps I should start with a simple explanation, as I did before. Let us consider the composition of a person's aether, shall we? There is corporeal aether of the flesh, incorporeal aether of the soul, and the aetherial residue of an individual's memories."
290,"TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_MIKOTO_300_401","Were one to be possessed of only corporeal aether, they would be but a walking corpse. Conversely, entities comprised of only incorporeal aether are referred to in layman's terms as ghosts. Of course, a ghost that possesses residual memories could likely recall its past and retain self-awareness."
291,"TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_MIKOTO_300_402","Using a crystal focus, we can isolate the aetherial signature of memories, much in the same way the seers did. We can then delve into and explore specific memories conjured by the subject."
292,"TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_MIKOTO_300_403","We must be careful of what we observe, however, for while the information stored in a person's memories can be quite comprehensive, it is not always true to fact. They can be distorted due to the passage of time, or even when first committed to the mind as a result of personal bias."
293,"TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_MIKOTO_300_404","That is why it is important to mark the distinction between explicit and implicit memories."
294,"TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_MIKOTO_300_405","Explicit memories are those consciously stored and recalled, while implicit memories are more passively accumulated by our subconscious."
295,"TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_MIKOTO_300_406","When meeting someone for the first time, their appearance will be kept as part of our explicit memory, though this may fade with the passing of time. Should a great deal of time pass without meeting, however, such recollection can prove difficult."
296,"TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_MIKOTO_300_407","Yet in that moment, your mind also takes record of everything experienced by your sensory nervous system."
297,"TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_MIKOTO_300_408","Unfortunately, information called from explicit memory is quite sensitive to misrepresentations of events. After all, if an individual is actively choosing to recall an event, who is to say they will not make alterations to better suit their liking?"
298,"TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_MIKOTO_300_409","That is why we seek information from implicit memory, which is more likely to be preserved free of the bias of an individual's worldview."
