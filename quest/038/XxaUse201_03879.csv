1,"TEXT_XXAUSE201_03879_SEQ_01","During a recent audit, it was discovered that the crystal stores of Amajina & Sons Mineral Concern have been covertly pillaged. Fearing that the culprits may have ties to the Amalj'aa, the Scions have agreed to assist in the investigation. Proceed to Horizon in western Thanalan and report to Y'shtola."
2,"TEXT_XXAUSE201_03879_SEQ_02","You find Y'shtola preoccupied and unwilling to converse at length. Speak to Fufulupa, the Brass Blade leading the investigation, to learn more about the thefts."
3,"TEXT_XXAUSE201_03879_SEQ_03","Fufulupa relays to you news about a carriage that broke through one of their checkpoints and bolted off down to eastern Thanalan, where they were taken into custody by the Brass Blades. He is all but convinced that the thieves have been apprehended and the crystals recovered, until your conversation is interrupted by Thancred, who reveals that the fugitives were no more than common somnus smugglers. Regroup with your friends at Horizon to review the current state of affairs and assess your options."
4,"TEXT_XXAUSE201_03879_SEQ_04","According to Thancred, there is nothing to suggest that the Amalj'aa have come into possession of significant quantities of crystals. As he communicates his findings to Urianger via linkpearl, you cannot help but wonder who is behind the crystal thefts, and what their designs might be."
