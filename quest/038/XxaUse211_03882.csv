1,"TEXT_XXAUSE211_03882_SEQ_01","Alphinaud believes it would be for the best if Yugiri made her formal introductions to the leaders of Revenant's Toll at the first opportunity. The Doman delegation would require an escort, of course, and he can think of no better <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If> for the job. Make your way to Revenant's Toll and speak with Slafborn."
2,"TEXT_XXAUSE211_03882_SEQ_02","Slafborn warmly welcomes Yugiri to Revenant's Toll, insisting that they dispense with unnecessary formality and treat each other as equals. Having paid your respects to the guild representative, ask Yugiri if she is ready to meet with Minfilia."
3,"TEXT_XXAUSE211_03882_SEQ_03","Deep in thought, Yugiri requests a moment's privacy, assuring you that she will join you anon. Enter the Rising Stones and look for Minfilia in the solar."
4,"TEXT_XXAUSE211_03882_SEQ_04","You find Minfilia attempting to contact the Students of Baldesion via linkpearl─more, you suspect, out of habit than hope. After briefly speculating upon their fate, she changes the subject and asks about the Domans─to which you reply that Yugiri will arrive at any moment. In the subsequent meeting, Minfilia assures Yugiri that she will do her utmost to accommodate her people, as well as any others who may follow. With formal introductions now complete, the guild emissary departs to greet the first wave of refugees. The Antecedent, however, is clearly concerned about something else. Speak with her and see what weighs on her mind."
5,"TEXT_XXAUSE211_03882_SEQ_05","Y'shtola returns from her investigation in Vylbrand, having confirmed beyond a shadow of a doubt that the Serpent Reavers were behind the crystal thefts. All evidence suggests that the Sahagin are preparing to summon Leviathan once more, and Admiral Merlwyb has petitioned the Scions' aid in preventing the primal's return. Desiring to learn the true nature of the Echo, Minfilia declares her intent to join you on this mission."
