2,"TEXT_XXAUSE413_03887_SEQ_02","With some help from Garlond Ironworks, the Alliance has managed to install communications-jamming devices around the city-states, ensuring that Eline Roaille will have no choice but to communicate with her accomplices in person. All that remains is to catch her in the act. Make for the Hawthorne Hut with Ilberd and Yugiri to pursue your quarry."

54,"TEXT_XXAUSE413_03887_ILBERD_000_013","An explanation is in order. You are no doubt aware that the Garleans have their own method of communicating over great distances."
55,"TEXT_XXAUSE413_03887_ILBERD_000_014","Well, our ingenious friends at Garlond Ironworks have provided us with devices which disrupt these communications, and we have installed them around the city–states. In so doing, we have made it difficult for imperial agents to correspond with their masters."
56,"TEXT_XXAUSE413_03887_ILBERD_000_015","Roaille would thus have no choice but to rendezvous with her imperial contact directly. Yet, as a well-known face in the Immortal Flames, she cannot move about Thanalan without being recognized. It would only be a matter of time before someone saw through her disguise."
