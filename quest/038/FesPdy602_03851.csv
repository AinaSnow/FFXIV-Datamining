※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESPDY602_03851_SEQ_01","While your impromptu Little Ladies' Day at Frondale's Phrontistery was a rousing success, Damielliot informs you that not all is well. It would seem Redolent Rose's visit was both a blessing and a curse, as the other young girls now expect Damielliot to arrange a special guest for each of them. The children's requests are fanciful at best, and Damielliot, overwhelmed with the magnitude of the task, humbly requests your aid in securing audiences with some of the storied figures you have met in your journeys. Reauverre has asked each of the girls to write a letter to the person─or persons─they would like to meet. Read them, and if anyone you know might fit the descriptions contained within, inform Reauverre and he will summon the others to the foyer.
