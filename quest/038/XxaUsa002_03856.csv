1,"TEXT_XXAUSA002_03856_SEQ_01","Vorsaile Heuloix would have you communicate directly with the sylphs and ascertain their true intentions regarding the primal Ramuh. To avoid any cross-cultural misunderstandings, you are to first travel to the Hawthorne Hut and receive a briefing on sylphic culture with the officer stationed there. Speak to Mitainie outside Westshore Pier in Old Gridania to see about transportation."

54,"TEXT_XXAUSA002_03856_VORSAILE_000_005","Aye, your little bird sings true. No doubt you've heard that we're investigating the sylphs─that curious beast tribe that calls the depths of the Twelveswood home."
55,"TEXT_XXAUSA002_03856_VORSAILE_000_006","The sylphs are, for the most part, a peaceable bunch─much to the delight of the Elder Seedseer, who has no desire to see her people embroiled in yet another fruitless war."
