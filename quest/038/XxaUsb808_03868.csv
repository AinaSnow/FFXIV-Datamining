1,"TEXT_XXAUSB808_03868_SEQ_01","Lord Haurchefant has bid you speak with the witness he discovered. The man in question should be waiting outside."
2,"TEXT_XXAUSB808_03868_SEQ_02","The cataloger states that he saw the <Emphasis>Enterprise</Emphasis> land near the Stone Vigil several days before the Calamity, which means that it was almost certainly seized by the garrison which occupied it at the time. Report your findings to Lord Haurchefant and see what advice he proffers."
3,"TEXT_XXAUSB808_03868_SEQ_03","Lord Haurchefant explains that the Stone Vigil is currently held by Dravanian forces, and that all access to the ruined outpost is restricted by House Durendaire. To help you obtain permission to enter the Stone Vigil, he writes for you a letter of introduction to Lord Drillemont of Whitebrim Front. However, he suspects that his endorsement alone will not suffice, and he advises you to ask Lord Francel to write a letter for you as well."
4,"TEXT_XXAUSB808_03868_SEQ_04","Lord Francel is happy to oblige your request. Before you depart, he reminds you that the cravens who attempted to destroy House Haillenarte have yet to be revealed, and that they may target you in the future in retaliation for your interference. Duly warned, proceed to Whitebrim Front and present your letters to the sentry at the gates."

Well, it so happens that I was monitoring the night sky at the Observatorium during that period. I recall that a small vessel came from the direction of Gridania and landed near the Stone Vigil, in the far northwest."
52,"TEXT_XXAUSB808_03868_NPC_000_012","The garrison almost certainly seized the vessel and brought it within their walls. If so, then you would need an army of knights to have any hope of securing it."
