49,"TEXT_BANQIQ122_03827_QHOTERLPASOL_000_001","I ask because one of the noble Viis told me of the owl statues housed within the pyramid, equipped with deadly traps meant to deter even the most intrepid grave robbers. Upon hearing the story, I was struck with inspiration."
50,"TEXT_BANQIQ122_03827_QHOTERLPASOL_000_002","I realized these very ruins could be equipped with such measures! Our surroundings are positively lousy with vicious beasts, and a few clever traps would go a long way to set everyone's mind at ease. Could I trouble you to assist me in making them?"
51,"TEXT_BANQIQ122_03827_QHOTERLPASOL_000_003","The device I have in mind will make use of the latent energies stored within magical stones. If you would bring me some from the K'mul Astropolis, I would be ever so grateful."

54,"TEXT_BANQIQ122_03827_QHOTERLPASOL_000_006","The latent power stored within the stones littered about the K'mul Astropolis ought to be just what I need. I'll wait here patiently until you return."
