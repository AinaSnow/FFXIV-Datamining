49,"TEXT_SUBCTS897_03018_SWYRGEIM_000_001","Would you be interested in helping to bring more glamour to the world? By that, I mean learning to make glamour prisms, either for personal use or to aid the aesthetically underprivileged."
50,"TEXT_SUBCTS897_03018_SWYRGEIM_000_003","I will explain everything in due course, but there is something I need to prepare beforehand."
51,"TEXT_SUBCTS897_03018_SWYRGEIM_000_004","Bring me some Othardian orange juice in the meantime, would you? Just ask Folclind, same as last time. Well? Staring at me isn't going to get that orange juice poured any quicker! Hurry up, would you?"
52,"TEXT_SUBCTS897_03018_SWYRGEIM_000_010","Don't tell me you're lost─it's only a few yalms away! I would get it myself, but as you can clearly see, I am rather busy."

54,"TEXT_SUBCTS897_03018_FOLCLIND_000_021","Well, here it is. I think she and I need to have a little chat about her tab. This order alone costs more than some of our big-drinking regulars spend in a whole night!"
55,"TEXT_SUBCTS897_03018_FOLCLIND_000_030","Around here, Othardian oranges are as rare as chocobo teeth. I can barely bring myself to squeeze the juice out of them, knowing how much they cost. I daren't spill a drop!"

59,"TEXT_SUBCTS897_03018_SWYRGEIM_000_043","To be perfectly frank, my expensive tastes in orange juice have to be paid for somehow. While my intentions are sincere, my reasons for helping you are not entirely altruistic."
60,"TEXT_SUBCTS897_03018_SWYRGEIM_000_044","Pass this letter to Goberin the merchant, and he'll allow you to browse his glamour prism recipe tomes. If you buy any of them, he'll give me a cut of the profits. You'll have the knowledge you seek, and I'll have money for orange juice. What could be more piquant?"
61,"TEXT_SUBCTS897_03018_SWYRGEIM_000_045","I will also send word to my associate Wiscard in Revenant's Toll. We have a similar arrangement, and I'm sure you'll find his prices just as fair as Goberin's."
62,"TEXT_SUBCTS897_03018_SWYRGEIM_000_046","You should start with Goberin though, since his stall's right there, by the Pissed Peiste. Once you've read one of those books, you'll be able to make the prisms yourself and share the glory of glamours with the masses!"
63,"TEXT_SUBCTS897_03018_SWYRGEIM_000_050","Goberin is very particular about accepting new customers. But once he sees that you have my personal recommendation, he is sure to welcome you with open arms!"
64,"TEXT_SUBCTS897_03018_GOBELIN_000_060","Ah, I sense you come in pursuit of true elegance. And is that a letter of introduction peeking from your pocket? May I see it?"
65,"TEXT_SUBCTS897_03018_GOBELIN_000_061","Ah! So, you are Swyrgeim's protégé? And you wish to produce glamour prisms? A noble endeavor. My selection of tomes, reserved for only the most deserving, are yours to peruse."
66,"TEXT_SUBCTS897_03018_SYSTEM_000_062","You may now purchase master crafting tomes from Goberin, as well as Tataroga in Mor Dhona."
