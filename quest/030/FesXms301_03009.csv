Owing to a recent theft of decorations, however, the festival now suffers from a lack of staff, as many have been tasked with tracking down the perpetrators. Amh Garanjy bids you consult with Baenfaeld in Bentbranch Meadows if you wish to be of assistance.

He and a trio of crimson-clad bears have been preparing a special treat for the festival, sure to bring a smile to one and all. Once you have chosen one of the three bears to act as your mount, the next part of the plan can be put into action."
