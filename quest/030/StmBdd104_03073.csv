54,"TEXT_STMBDD104_03073_HIEN_000_011","It is, by any measure, a cruel twist, not least for Gosetsu...but one which does not invalidate our agreement.

By that reckoning, all is...if not as it should be, then...as it <Emphasis>must</Emphasis> be. This I can accept."

79,"TEXT_STMBDD104_03073_HIEN_000_033","But let us speak seriously. I stand before you not to demand your fealty, but to request your aid once more."
80,"TEXT_STMBDD104_03073_RASHO_000_034","Mayhap you are confused. Doma's liberation was but a means to an end. We aided you only to save ourselves."
81,"TEXT_STMBDD104_03073_RASHO_000_035","Now we have no such incentive. We have sworn no oath to you, and will not come running like hounds at their master's whistle."
82,"TEXT_STMBDD104_03073_HIEN_000_036","And I would not presume to treat you thus. I come to petition your cooperation as an ally of equal standing."
83,"TEXT_STMBDD104_03073_TANSUI_000_037","Equal standing, you say? Seems a bit lopsided to me. Where's the profit for us in all of this?"

You'll find we're simple souls: you pay our tithe, you sail in peace; deny us our due and we take it by force. We'll pull you out of the water if we see you drowning, but we are not in the business of doing something for nothing."
86,"TEXT_STMBDD104_03073_HIEN_000_040","Calm yourself, Mistress Alisaie. We did not come here to moralize. We came here to talk. And there is more to be said."
87,"TEXT_STMBDD104_03073_HIEN_000_041","According to records recovered after the liberation, relatives of your Doman-born brethren were among those conscripted into the imperial army. And as you may be aware, we recently negotiated the return of said conscripts. Many, alas, will arrive to find no families waiting for them, no homes to grant them shelter."
88,"TEXT_STMBDD104_03073_HIEN_000_042","I would ask that you offer them a place in the Confederacy. You would not be rescuing strangers, but welcoming brothers and sisters into your ranks. And has not the Confederacy been in need of new recruits...?"

90,"TEXT_STMBDD104_03073_TANSUI_000_044","The losses we suffered at the Garleans' hands are no secret. But since we drove them out of Doma, the Ruby Sea has come alive with traders and travelers. So many vessels to tax, so few pirates to tax them."
91,"TEXT_STMBDD104_03073_TANSUI_100_044","We could do with some more hands on deck, and doubly so if they're familiar with the inner workings of the Empire."
92,"TEXT_STMBDD104_03073_RASHO_000_045","Very well. The Confederacy agrees to your request. You will have your ship."
93,"TEXT_STMBDD104_03073_RASHO_000_046","...But before that, you must do something for me. The vessel I have in mind was damaged during your battle with the Empire. Though we have mended her, she has yet to be declared seaworthy."
94,"TEXT_STMBDD104_03073_RASHO_000_047","She is sound enough down below, but when you load her up with conscripts and the waterline rises...those upper planks had best be free of cracks."
95,"TEXT_STMBDD104_03073_RASHO_000_048","Assuming you want your people to stay dry, you will do me the favor of swimming around the hull to check for weaknesses. That is, if Doman lords are not averse to getting their robes wet?"
96,"TEXT_STMBDD104_03073_HIEN_000_049","Not this Doman lord! If we each inspect a third of the ship, it shall be done in a trice."
97,"TEXT_STMBDD104_03073_RASHO_000_050","That is the spirit. The ship is moored at Quickscape Pier. Our apprentice shipwright will be on deck to hear your report. Look for a lad named Ihanashi."
98,"TEXT_STMBDD104_03073_ALISAIE_000_051","And I thought I had a knack for parleying with pirates... For the record, my previous attempt was an unmitigated success, and <Emphasis>yes</Emphasis>, I should have quit while I was ahead."
99,"TEXT_STMBDD104_03073_TANSUI_100_052","Well, well. I'd thought the rumors exaggerated, but the young lord lives up to his reputation..."

102,"TEXT_STMBDD104_03073_ALISAIE_000_057","For once, I'm actually glad Yugiri isn't here. I doubt she would have taken kindly to a pirate inviting Hien to inspect his hull..."
103,"TEXT_STMBDD104_03073_HIEN_000_058","The water is so invigorating! I have not swum in the Ruby Sea since─ Ah, but I should be concentrating on the task at hand!"
104,"TEXT_STMBDD104_03073_IHANASHI_000_059","...Ihanashi? Aye, that's me. The captain said someone would be coming to inspect the hull. You...haven't finished already, have you?"

107,"TEXT_STMBDD104_03073_IHANASHI_000_070","Aye, I'm the shipwright─er, <Emphasis>apprentice</Emphasis> shipwright. Did you find anything that might need attention?"

109,"TEXT_STMBDD104_03073_IHANASHI_000_072","...On the port side, near the bow, you say? All right, I'll have a look and see what I can do."
110,"TEXT_STMBDD104_03073_HIEN_000_073","My apologies, I seem to have lagged behind. I could float in that gentle sea all day...
Otherwise, I am happy to report no visible cracking or holes in my section of the hull."
111,"TEXT_STMBDD104_03073_IHANASHI_000_074","You─ Y-You─ You're Lord Hien! The captain sent <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> to inspect the hull!? Kami have mercy... Forgive us this discourtesy, my lord!"
112,"TEXT_STMBDD104_03073_HIEN_000_075","Hah! 'Tis quite all right. In fact, I rather enjoyed it. I take it you are of Doma?"
113,"TEXT_STMBDD104_03073_IHANASHI_000_076","Y-Yes, my lord. The imperials took my father away after the uprising, and I had nowhere else to turn. The Confederacy became my family."
114,"TEXT_STMBDD104_03073_IHANASHI_000_077","But someone told me they're releasing the conscripts now. Maybe my father will be among them. Not that I can go back─there's no leaving once you've joined..."

116,"TEXT_STMBDD104_03073_IHANASHI_000_079","Captain! W-We've found a small crack in the port side, but I'll have it fixed before you know it!"
117,"TEXT_STMBDD104_03073_RASHO_000_080","I see you have met the boy. Did he tell you his story? He babbles when he is nervous."
118,"TEXT_STMBDD104_03073_RASHO_000_081","Should his father be among the conscripts, as he hopes, I mean to give him the choice to leave this life. If he so chooses, I expect you to see they are provided for."
119,"TEXT_STMBDD104_03073_HIEN_000_082","I have heard that those who join the Confederacy forswear all ties with kin and homeland. Is that oath so easily put aside?"
120,"TEXT_STMBDD104_03073_RASHO_000_083","If I allow it.
...I see in him the lad I was twenty-five years ago. You say the words, you mean them, but the yearning for home still lingers."
121,"TEXT_STMBDD104_03073_RASHO_000_084","My family is long dead, and I know this life is my lot. But he has scarce dipped his toes with us. If there is a life for him in Doma, he should have the chance to live it."
122,"TEXT_STMBDD104_03073_HIEN_000_085","Well said. The Empire's conquest has uprooted many and more. Be it in Yanxia or out on the Ruby Sea, we have a duty to ensure that Ihanashi and others like him are free to dwell where they desire."
