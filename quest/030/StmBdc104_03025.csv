75,"TEXT_STMBDC104_03025_HANAME_000_071","I, uh... I wondered if I should tell someone, as it happens. He did not look well, you see. I asked if aught was the matter and he told me the past had caught up with him. But I doubt it was that. There are older men in our ranks."
76,"TEXT_STMBDC104_03025_KAIDATE_000_075","Captain Jifuya? He was headed for the northern entrance when I saw him last. I was going to invite him to train with us, but he did not hear me call out to him."

89,"TEXT_STMBDC104_03025_HIEN_000_105","So Jifuya went for some fresh air, did he? Whatever his business may be, I hope you find him soon."
