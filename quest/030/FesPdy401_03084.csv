1,"TEXT_FESPDY401_03084_SEQ_01","A reporter from the <Emphasis>Mythril Eye</Emphasis> is stopping all passersby to take a survey about this year's Little Ladies' Day celebration, and that includes you. As he tells it, Ul'dah is abuzz with talk of the festivities planned, the main event being a special performance by the Songbirds. After taking note of your thoughts on the matter, he encourages you to speak with the royal seneschal over on Emerald Avenue to learn more.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESPDY401_03084_SEQ_02","The royal seneschal is heartened by your enthusiasm to take part in the performance. But you cannot join without first being properly dressed for the occasion. He explains to you that everyone who attends will require a special set of garments and illuminations, offering you a promissory note to redeem a set for yourself. The royal seneschal then sends you off to the Weavers' Guild and Alchemists' Guild, eagerly awaiting your return."
3,"TEXT_FESPDY401_03084_SEQ_03","After a brief visit to the Weavers' and Alchemists' guilds, you are now the proud owner of three stylish Songbird ensembles and a set of illuminated rods. The royal seneschal will be glad to hear you procured them without incident."

5,"TEXT_FESPDY401_03084_SEQ_05","Ul'dah is alive with the sound of music, and you helped make it possible. Though the show is over, the energy in the air is palpable. A pity the royal seneschal's duties kept him away from the merrymaking. He would no doubt be glad to hear your impressions of the Songbirds's performance."
6,"TEXT_FESPDY401_03084_SEQ_06","The royal seneschal is expressing his gratitude for your taking time to see the Songbirds when they happen to pass by. They each offer you a heartfelt thanks before making a quick exit to prepare for their next show. The support of the people of Ul'dah has helped the Songbirds reach new heights in their musical prowess, but the celebration is far from finished. The streets continue to echo with their sweet birdsong. Should you be interested in seeing them perform once more, you can be certain they will be looking for you in the crowd."
