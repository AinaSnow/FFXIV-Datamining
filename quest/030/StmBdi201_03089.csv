Before a consensus can be reached, Ramza foments new tension with his sister by questioning her commitment to the family mission. It is during this fraternal spat that an uninvited guest enters stage right."

Ramza is quick to dismiss him, but in doing so, inadvertently presents Montblanc with a challenge─slay a beast, and earn apprenticeship aboard the <Emphasis>Prima Vista</Emphasis>. Eager to prove his worth, the sorely overmatched and under-armored moogle marches out into the wilds to meet his prey...and most likely his maker."

With no leads, however, the captain's rescue seems impossible...until Jenomis discovers a mysterious addition on the final page of his journal.
