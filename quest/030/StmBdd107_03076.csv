Ascian involvement seems all but certain at this point, and Thancred offers to infiltrate the Empire's western provinces to seek out further information. With Y'shtola's time already committed to a scholarly expedition to Doma, Alisaie reluctantly agrees to hold the fort at the Rising Stones."

67,"TEXT_STMBDD107_03076_THANCRED_000_015","After you left, I went about questioning Bloodhowe's gravekeepers. They all told much the same story: once Lyse and her officers had confirmed Zenos dead, his corpse was interred under strict supervision."
68,"TEXT_STMBDD107_03076_THANCRED_000_016","There seems little reason to doubt their testimony on that point, but when I mentioned the defacement of Zenos's grave, accounts grew rather more vague."
