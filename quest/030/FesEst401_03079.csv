According to the distressed Lalafell, Jihli has been denied her customary prophetic dream this year and thus the Dreamers have settled for arranging an egg hunt around town. The festival eggs in question, however, appear to have been stolen. Join forces with the Hatching–tide hunter near the Greatloam Growery, and see what can be done to save the celebrations.
