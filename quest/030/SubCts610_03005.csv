57,"TEXT_SUBCTS610_03005_MNAAGO_000_012","...I'm surprised. I knew you were many things, but an accomplished artisan was not one of them."
58,"TEXT_SUBCTS610_03005_MNAAGO_000_013","We would've been fools to turn you away when you offered to help the Resistance, and I'd be a fool to do it now."

60,"TEXT_SUBCTS610_03005_MNAAGO_000_015","The ones who aren't here to see what we've accomplished. A free Ala Mhigo. A new beginning. A new future."

63,"TEXT_SUBCTS610_03005_MNAAGO_000_018","We'd won them freedom, aye. The freedom to be poor and die starving. Where's the justice in that?"
64,"TEXT_SUBCTS610_03005_MNAAGO_000_019","So I decided I'd do something about it. I'd establish a fund for the widows and the orphans─our way of giving a little back in honor of those who gave us their all."
65,"TEXT_SUBCTS610_03005_MNAAGO_000_020","There was just one problem: I don't know the first thing about making gil. Other than soldiering, my only other talent was hunting─and I'll not raise more than a fraction of what I need selling pelts."
66,"TEXT_SUBCTS610_03005_MNAAGO_000_021","But when little Galiena told me about collectables and the prices people were willing to pay, I knew I'd found the answer."
67,"TEXT_SUBCTS610_03005_MNAAGO_000_022","I'll not deny I've got a lot to learn, but I'm ready and willing to give it my all. So what say you? Up for helping me fill custom orders for a good cause?"
68,"TEXT_SUBCTS610_03005_MNAAGO_000_023","'Course, I'll not ask you to do it for free. You'll get your cut─scrips good with any of the House's people."
