1,"TEXT_BANANA005_03040_SEQ_01","A merchant suddenly bursts into the castellum claiming that fighting has broken out between groups of Ananta in Virdjala. Upon hearing this unsettling news, Alpa's immediate concern is that her mother would be angry that Ananta should be allowed to cause trouble so close to Velodyna. Showing no signs of hesitation, she and J'olhmyn race off in the direction of the valley, heedless of the dangers they may face.

3,"TEXT_BANANA005_03040_SEQ_03","A wounded Qalyana who escaped the bloodshed reveals that an internal conflict has erupted in her tribe. Several of her people oppose worshipping the primal Sri Lakshmi and have split from the rest of the Qalyana. Unwilling to accept this, those in the thrall of the false goddess have marked the insurrectionists for death. Hoping to locate the remaining survivors before it is too late, you continue the search."

After the battle, the Vira broodmother Sarisha arrives and offers the refugees asylum in Vira Nilya. However, they are determined to express their gratitude for Alpa's courageous rescue by joining the Gatekeepers. She gladly welcomes her newfound allies and leads them to Velodyna."
6,"TEXT_BANANA005_03040_SEQ_06","J'olhmyn expresses concerns that accepting the Qalyana refugees carries the risk of spies infiltrating the Resistance. However, Alpa believes that the Qalyana would have little to gain from such an act of espionage and that any treachery can be dealt with as needed. While J'olhmyn is able to accept Alpa's argument, she remains cautious of the new recruits. Shortly after, Sarisha arrives to look over the castellum and reminds Alpa of the consequences should it fail to meet her standards. Although Alpa is extremely anxious to hear her mother's evaluation, she has no choice but to wait patiently, but is finally able to breathe a sigh of relief when the fortress passes the inspection. Not only was Alpa's work on the castellum beyond all expectations, but her bravery and even-handed diplomacy left a deep impression on the broodmother, who gives her blessing to continue working with the Gatekeepers."
