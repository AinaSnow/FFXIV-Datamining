1,"TEXT_STMBDD106_03075_SEQ_01","Alisaie declares the Scions' work in Doma done, and turns her gaze towards Rhalgr's Reach. Lyse will want to hear of Zenos's rumored resurrection..."
2,"TEXT_STMBDD106_03075_SEQ_02","Lyse reacts to the news of Zenos's return with predictable disbelief, but Thancred is on hand to propose a simple─if somewhat unsavory─way of settling the matter. Journey to Bloodhowe in the Lochs, and inspect the crown prince's mortal remains."
3,"TEXT_STMBDD106_03075_SEQ_03","You heave aside the weighty stone lid atop Zenos's resting place, but contrary to Thancred's predictions, find no writhing snakes or scuttling spiders waiting for you within. The coffin is empty. Leaving Thancred to track down the workers responsible for interring the late viceroy, you prepare to return to the Rising Stones with Alisaie. The other Scions must hear of this development, and the possibility that an Ascian now holds court in Garlemald."
4,"TEXT_STMBDD106_03075_SEQ_04","You arrive to find that Alisaie has already made a full report to Urianger via linkpearl. Soon after, you are joined by Y'shtola, who listens carefully to the facts before agreeing that Ascian possession is indeed the most likely explanation. It would seem that Alphinaud has entered into a deadly web of intrigue, and Alisaie cannot help but worry for her brother's safety..."
