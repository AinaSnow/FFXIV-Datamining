1,"TEXT_STMBDR203_03033_SEQ_01","After Cid describes the nature of your next opponent, Nero presents you with a new invention designed to aid in its defeat─the Chocobo Brush. Though he leaves you none the wiser about how it actually works, you gather that the brush will allow you to directly influence the world in which you find yourself. Speak with the waiting Alpha to begin the next stage of Omega's experiment.

He is in the midst of warning you about the brush's decidedly limited range of alternative applications when Cid receives a linkpearl communication from Jessie. It seems that Biggs and Wedge have slipped away from their sickbeds, intent on returning to the Yawn..."
5,"TEXT_STMBDR203_03033_SEQ_05","Outside the rift once more, you meet with an anxious Biggs and Wedge. Cid reassures them that, despite some minor difficulties, you have managed to overcome each of Omega's challenges thus far. The two engineers duly pledge their unswerving support, and you cannot help but feel buoyed by their infectious enthusiasm."
