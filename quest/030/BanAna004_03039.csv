※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANANA004_03039_SEQ_01","An Ala Mhigan traveler returning to his homeland has fallen ill while staying at Castellum Velodyna. While Alpa and J'olhmyn are discussing his condition, M'zhet Tia, self-proclaimed future nunh of the M tribe, makes an unexpected appearance and reveals that he has in fact volunteered to aid the Gatekeepers. He also claims that the stricken guest is in fact lovesick, a concept Alpa finds hard to grasp. With total disregard for more immediate concerns, M'zhet asks the group to meet him at Pike Falls, where he will demonstrate the power of love.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANANA004_03039_SEQ_02","After gathering an audience, the would-be nunh of the M tribe insists that the power of love can protect him from anything, including imperial grenades. In spite of Alpa's apparent concern, he asks you to pelt him with explosives in order to prove his point. He also makes it clear that he wants you to continue throwing, even if he tells you to stop."
3,"TEXT_BANANA004_03039_SEQ_03","M'zhet was supposed to have removed some of the powder from the grenades to reduce their destructive force.

5,"TEXT_BANANA004_03039_SEQ_05","M'zhet miraculously survives the final grenade while J'olhmyn comes to the conclusion that the power of love has little to do with one's resilience to explosions. Meanwhile, the bedridden traveler has still not received any treatment, so the group decides to call on the expertise of Orella, the Resistance's resident physician."
6,"TEXT_BANANA004_03039_SEQ_06","Orella has a hunch that the disease can be cured with a mixture that includes lightning caps. However, Orella's stock has been depleted, so you head to East End with Alpa to gather these rare mushrooms."
7,"TEXT_BANANA004_03039_SEQ_07","While gathering lightning caps, Alpa is suddenly attacked by deadly flora. Luckily, you arrive to prevent her untimely demise. After disposing of the woodland predators, you rush to her aid."
8,"TEXT_BANANA004_03039_SEQ_08","It seems that only Alpa's pride was wounded and she recovers quickly. Despite her unfortunate encounter, the lightning caps she has gathered are still intact. All that remains is to deliver them to Orella at Castellum Velodyna."
9,"TEXT_BANANA004_03039_SEQ_09","You return to the castellum, where Alpa informs you that she has given the mushrooms to Orella. The medicine that she prepares takes effect with astonishing rapidity, healing the stricken traveler almost instantly. However, he reveals that he is suffering from lovesickness following his encounter with Orella and chases after her to confess his feelings. If Alpa has learned anything from this episode, it is that even in times of relative peace, people are still prone to injury and disease. She comes to the conclusion that an infirmary would be a worthy addition to the castellum."
