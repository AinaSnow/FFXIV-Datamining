※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESHLW403_03013_SEQ_01","The Adventurers' Guild investigator has recently heard that the preparations for the Continental Circus's haunted manor are now complete. Admittedly, given the failure of the troupe's plans in stoking the fears of the populace, this development is of less concern than before, but if you have a mind to investigate, a certain illusionist can tell you more.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."

Should you wish to experience the manor's “amusements” for yourself, you need only seek out one the troupe's harlequin guides."
