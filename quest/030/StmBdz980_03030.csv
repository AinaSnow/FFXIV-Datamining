1,"TEXT_STMBDZ980_03030_SEQ_01","A peddler you encounter in Rhalgr's Reach recognizes you as the hero of the Ala Mhigan revolution. After thanking you profusely for your role in improving his life, he passes on a request from Wiscar, asking that you visit the Lochs─and the Saltery─at your earliest convenience."
2,"TEXT_STMBDZ980_03030_SEQ_02","You arrive in the Lochs to find Wiscar eager to show you the sights of the restored Saltery. The air buzzes with activity, and you hear the enthusiastic cries of merchants as they seek to secure a favorable price..."
3,"TEXT_STMBDZ980_03030_SEQ_03","With wonder bordering on disbelief, Wiscar points out the bustle of commerce which now fills the previously desolate village. Next on the tour: a look at the heart of the Saltery's operations."
4,"TEXT_STMBDZ980_03030_SEQ_04","Now that you've witnessed the revival you helped begin, Wiscar urges you to have a word with his grandfather. Watt awaits you near the center of the village."
5,"TEXT_STMBDZ980_03030_SEQ_05","Even as Watt welcomes your visit to the Saltery, your reunion is interrupted by the arrival of “Lady Lilira” and a familiar manservant. Judging by her exchange with the village elder, it seems the disguised sultana has come to ensure all is well following the deal brokered with Lolorito and his East Aldenard Trading Company. Nanamo leaves satisfied, and the workers of the Saltery gather to express to you their gratitude. Though the salt is once more flowing, the assembled Ala Mhigans are dedicated to completing the village's restoration, and sharing their prosperity across the region."

81,"TEXT_STMBDZ980_03030_WATT_000_044","Ahahaha, now there's a pretty picture! Can you imagine the sultana herself trudging through malms of dusty countryside just to visit our humble village?"

84,"TEXT_STMBDZ980_03030_WATT_000_047","Oh, you know each other, then? I s'pose an adventurer meets all sorts of folk, trudging from one end of the realm to the other."
85,"TEXT_STMBDZ980_03030_NANAMOULNAMO_000_048","Yes, well... Ahem, Master Watt, I must compliment you on your salted fish. The dish we sampled was exquisite!"
86,"TEXT_STMBDZ980_03030_WATT_000_049","Thank you, miss. The Saltery was once famous not only for its salt, but also the goods we seasoned with its produce. We hoped you might take a reminder of that taste back to the people of Ul'dah."
87,"TEXT_STMBDZ980_03030_NANAMOULNAMO_000_050","Yes, I will certainly discuss the potential for bringing such wares to market with our partners."
88,"TEXT_STMBDZ980_03030_NANAMOULNAMO_000_051","And whilst we are on the subject of partners, Master Watt, I understand you run the Saltery with the assistance of the East Aldenard Trading Company. Are the profits of your joint venture being properly apportioned?"
89,"TEXT_STMBDZ980_03030_WATT_000_052","I'm not sure I follow, miss..."

95,"TEXT_STMBDZ980_03030_WISCAR_000_058","She was a bit full of herself, wasn't she? The way she spoke, you'd think she was bloody royalty or something..."
96,"TEXT_STMBDZ980_03030_WATT_000_059","Seeing as our young hero's come to visit, what say we gather everyone to mark the occasion?"
97,"TEXT_STMBDZ980_03030_WATT_000_060","The battle with the Empire took its toll, and left our Saltery in ruins. We were left to squat in the rubble of our livelihood."
98,"TEXT_STMBDZ980_03030_WATT_000_061","But look now: our kin return to us from Ul'dah, and our village is alive again with peddlers and traders."
99,"TEXT_STMBDZ980_03030_WATT_000_062","We had neither the coin nor the might to remake our home, until you and the sultana took our cause as your own. For that, we are truly thankful."
100,"TEXT_STMBDZ980_03030_WATT_000_063","We've rebuilt what was needed to get things running, aye, but war's talons gouged deep."
101,"TEXT_STMBDZ980_03030_WATT_100_063","Many buildings still lie broken, and it'll take time to put it all back the way it was."
102,"TEXT_STMBDZ980_03030_WATT_000_064","But we won't let your boon go to waste. Day by day, we'll keep adding to this foundation you've laid, and bring lasting prosperity for all of Ala Mhigo!"
