※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESVLT401_03082_SEQ_01","Valentione's Day, that celebration of ardor and affection, is come to Eorzea once more, and the indomitable Lisette de Valentione has returned to spread the message of love across the land. This year, she and her crew are collaborating with the Sanctum of the Twelve to deliver an all-new experience in matchmaking, and she cordially invites you to participate before seamlessly transitioning into a request. She asks that you lend a hand to a trainee named Astrid, whom she worries is too sober and rational to discharge her duties. If you have a mind to oblige, you will find the girl nearby at Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESVLT401_03082_SEQ_02","A few sentences into your acquaintance, Astrid reveals that her preparation for the affinity test has stalled. The three moogles tasked with setting up the venue have abandoned their work, and at this rate the event cannot begin. It falls to you to seek out the moogles and discover the reason behind their untimely desertion."
3,"TEXT_FESVLT401_03082_SEQ_03","You speak with each of the moogles in turn, and they all blame their lack of motivation on Astrid's affinity test, which they complain is “stiff and dry,” “all remonstrance and no romance,” and “dull and uninspired.” Yet in spite of their insistence─or perhaps because of it─you cannot shake the sense that laziness is also a factor. Thus informed, you turn your steps back to Astrid."
4,"TEXT_FESVLT401_03082_SEQ_04","Astrid is distraught to learn that her affinity test is looked upon so unfavorably by her own helpers. Nevertheless, she is determined to rectify the issues raised and make the test fit for public enjoyment. Here, Hortefense shamelessly maneuvers himself into the conversation and suggests that you turn to a moogle for advice. Though loath to accept any sort of help from her brother-in-law, Astrid concedes that he speaks true, and together you set off to find Kuplu Kumu, the leader of the Sanctum choir."
5,"TEXT_FESVLT401_03082_SEQ_05","Upon being apprised of the situation, Kuplu Kumu confesses that he had anticipated a problem with the affinity test. Whereas Astrid attempted to bring tangibility to love, love is anything but tangible. From the moogle's words, Astrid comes to understand that what her test needs is a dose of fun. While she and Kuplu Kumu discuss ways to improve it, you are tasked with rounding up the three lazy moogles. They are like to be found over by the Leatherworkers' Guild, their preferred place for being unproductive."
6,"TEXT_FESVLT401_03082_SEQ_06","Though initially uncooperative, the moogles respond well to your magic words. Together they flutter off back to Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre, and you follow in their wingbeats."
7,"TEXT_FESVLT401_03082_SEQ_07","Astrid happily reports that, thanks to Kuplu Kumu's input, her affinity test has been brought up to acceptable standards of fun. Furthermore, the three moogles have returned and promptly completed their work on the venue. All that remains, then, is to have a couple actually trial the test, henceforth known as the Valentione's Ceremony, and Astrid would have you and your chosen partner do the honors. When you are ready, the House Valentione servant will escort you to the venue. At the ceremony's conclusion, you will receive a Valentione's Day chocolate, which Astrid bids you bring to her."
8,"TEXT_FESVLT401_03082_SEQ_08","The trial ceremony is concluded, and you return to Astrid with the Valentione's Day chocolate. Satisfied with the results, she declares the ceremony ready to be opened to the public. Offering you her heartfelt thanks, Astrid assures you that she will be fine from here on. Your work is done; time to report back to Lisette."
9,"TEXT_FESVLT401_03082_SEQ_09","Lisette is pleased to hear that all has gone well with her little sister, whom she wishes to be independent. And when Astrid returns with news of the ceremony's positive reception, Lisette takes the opportunity to declare her traineeship complete. Astrid's experiences this day will doubtless make her into a fine emissary, and you take pride in the knowledge that you were a part of her journey. May she succeed in her mission to till the fields of love within people's hearts."
