1,"TEXT_CHRHDB721_03020_SEQ_01","Not content to remain idle, Nashu Mhakaracca has been aggressively pursuing any and all leads regarding the Kugane Wolf Burglar. From the various eyewitness accounts, she has managed to create a composite sketch of the infamous thief...though whether or not it will prove useful remains to be seen. In any event, you both decide it may be worthwhile to make renewed inquiries of Kugane's wealthy and powerful."
2,"TEXT_CHRHDB721_03020_SEQ_02","The burglar's reputation has only grown since last you spoke with the citizenry, and it is plain that he is growing bolder and bolder by the day. Despite this, the Sekiseigumi still has no leads─and neither do you..."
3,"TEXT_CHRHDB721_03020_SEQ_03","While conversing with Nashu you run into Shigure once more─or rather, Shigure runs into a certain cheese-loving Lalafell, who quickly flees before Nashu can take notice. It would seem that he too is still in pursuit of the Wolf Burglar, and informs you of an impending private auction he is bound for that he suspects may be the thief's next target. Nashu quickly insists that you join, and so the three of you head towards Kogane Dori."
4,"TEXT_CHRHDB721_03020_SEQ_04","The auction is an intimate affair, attended by a handful of Kugane's most wealthy individuals─Master Akebono among them. He purchases the first item up for bid, which is described by the auctioneer as a legendary “ratman,” but which you and Nashu recognize at once to be an Eorzean Qiqirn. After the hapless beastman is shuffled away, the next item up for bid is brought on stage: <Emphasis>The Eoruzean Gentleman</Emphasis>, which the auctioneer claims to be a triumph of Western sculpture, but which is plainly Inspector Hildibrand, somehow frozen in time. Once more Master Akebono is prepared to take on all comers, but before the sale can be finalized, the auction erupts into chaos when a bomb explodes and fills the area with smoke. When it clears, <Emphasis>The Eoruzean Gentleman</Emphasis> is nowhere to be seen. An all-too-familiar note reveals that the Wolf Burglar has struck again, and Master Akebono urges you to give chase, for he glimpsed the thief running towards the Short Pier."
5,"TEXT_CHRHDB721_03020_SEQ_05","Fortunately, the Wolf Burglar's brazen crime has attracted more attention than usual. 'Tis a rare thing indeed, a Lupin carrying a hideous statue on his back, and the captain Shigure questions at the pier will not soon forget the sight. Apparently the thief boarded a boat and set forth for the Ruby Price, and so the chase continues."
6,"TEXT_CHRHDB721_03020_SEQ_06","Alas, with the recent liberation of Doma and the withdrawal of Garlean forces, the Ruby Price has seen increased traffic, and the watchmen there have been instructed to give departing vessels only a cursory glance if they are especially small.
