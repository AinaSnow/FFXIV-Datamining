1,"TEXT_GAIUSA304_00736_SEQ_01","The researcher Tanga Tonga has need of an adventurer to aid in his study of the Thalaos boneyard. Survey the excavation site to see if you can discover any fossils worth recovering."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSA304_00736_SEQ_02","You have found a couple different kinds of fossil that might serve to pique Tanga Tonga's interest. Return to the researcher in his cabin and let him pore over your discoveries."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSA304_00736_SEQ_03","Tanga Tonga has identified two types of ancient creatures from the fossils you have brought him: a large sea animal eaten by Thalaos, and a small parasite that clung to the Thalaos. With these new discoveries, he has enough information to advance his studies for the time being."

57,"TEXT_GAIUSA304_00736_TANGATOTUNGA_000_037","Ah, forgive me. We scholars tend to assume all know as much of our subject matter as we. Do you know of the tale of Thalaos? It is said Llymlaen summoned the massive serpent upon the primordial dry, and from its belly it spewed forth the waters which became the seas."

Indeed, whatever beast this was first came to be called that by virtue of its size alone. But I, for one, now dare to believe. It just may be that these bones are those of the divine serpent that brought life into this world."
