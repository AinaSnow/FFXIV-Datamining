2,"TEXT_SUBWIL142_00705_SEQ_02","Rowena tells you about a weaponsmith of no small repute named Gerolt, who she claims is skilled in the restoration of ancient relics. Find Gerolt at Hyrstmill in the North Shroud, and show him the promise of payment that Rowena has given you."
3,"TEXT_SUBWIL142_00705_SEQ_03","You meet and speak with Gerolt. Shamelessly exploiting the prodigious debt he owes Rowena, you coerce the man into lending you his expertise in the restoration of a relic weapon. Do as Gerolt directs if you wish to become the proud owner of a legendary arm of yore."

And the last time I <Emphasis>did</Emphasis>, the ol' fool had tears in his eyes and snot drippin' from his nose. “Fallen on hard times,” he said. Asked for a bit o' coin to tide him over. Never paid me back, neither."

You might do well to commission his work. He'll even reforge the relics of old if you make it worth his while, and there ain't no other in Eorzea as can do that."
