2,"TEXT_GAIUSA509_00761_SEQ_02","Based on the scant information you acquired from the sentries, it would seem that Lahabrea is in some way connected to Little Ala Mhigo. Return to Gisilbehrt and share with him what you have learned."

49,"TEXT_GAIUSA509_00761_GISILBEHRT_000_001","Owing to their hardships, the refugees don't trust anyone but themselves. Not even my men and I can get so much as a word of thanks out of them despite watching the place day and night."

63,"TEXT_GAIUSA509_00761_GISILBEHRT_000_041","If you're to get any further in your investigation, seems to me you'll need the cooperation of the Ala Mhigans. For this, you'll need to win their trust, and that won't be an easy task."
