1,"TEXT_GAIUSA003_00709_SEQ_01","Rolfe's memory is not what it used to be, but it turns out that he has previously shared his stories with those around the hut. Check in with his daughter Ysabel and a couple of the patrolling sentries, Blaisette and Monne. They may remember what the old storyteller has forgotten."

3,"TEXT_GAIUSA003_00709_SEQ_03","Your findings have served to stir Rolfe's memory, and he recalls that dancing is the traditional greeting among the sylphs. It would seem they are a most curious tribe, indeed."

49,"TEXT_GAIUSA003_00709_ROLFE_000_001","They're... They're... Er... <sigh> Beg pardon, friend. My memory's just not what it used to be. I've seen much and more in my adventuring days, and it's all a clutter in my noggin now. Though, I've shared my stories with those around the hut before. You might have more luck with them."
50,"TEXT_GAIUSA003_00709_YSABEL_000_010","The sylphs? Yes, Father's told me his stories <Emphasis>plenty</Emphasis> of times. What I've always found most captivating is how their concept of etiquette is almost completely alien to our own."

56,"TEXT_GAIUSA003_00709_ROLFE_000_031","Yes, nothing brings people together quite like a little toe-tapping. A sylph told me long ago that dancing is a time-honored greeting among their kind. You'd do well to remember this─it just may help win the favor of our forest friends."
