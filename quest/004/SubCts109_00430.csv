1,"TEXT_SUBCTS109_00430_SEQ_01","Upon learning that it was you who purged the Lambs of Dalamud from the bowels of Amdapor Keep, Lauriane informs you there is one who would speak with you. His name is Brother Adestan, and he waits at Camp Tranquil in the South Shroud. Venture there to hear his story."
2,"TEXT_SUBCTS109_00430_SEQ_02","Brother Adestan reveals that he is investigating Amdapor Keep at the behest of A–Ruhn–Senna. New evil festers within the castle walls, and its source is voidsent invoked by an unknown fiend. While the mystery of the summoner can wait, the voidsent threat must be destroyed with all haste for the good of the Shroud. Adestan bids you speak with Maxinne, the guard watching over Amdapor Keep, that you might behold the terrors within for yourself."
3,"TEXT_SUBCTS109_00430_SEQ_03","Maxinne grants you entry to the castle, but not without a warning. The darkness inside has made the forest life turn savage and feral. It will pose a deadly challenge to you until the voidsent lord lurking at the castle's heart is defeated.

※Amdapor Keep (Hard) can be accessed via the Duty Finder."
4,"TEXT_SUBCTS109_00430_SEQ_04","You have felled the voidsent lord, a nightmarish being seemingly garbed in harlequin's attire. Return to Camp Tranquil and tell Brother Adestan that you have had the last laugh."
5,"TEXT_SUBCTS109_00430_SEQ_05","After hearing of your adventure, Adestan realizes the voidsent were summoned forth not by the living, but rather by the dead. The Lambs of Dalamud's dark rites had been complete but for blood. When you purged them, their vitality ran forth over the ground, and brought their foul rituals to fruition. Adestan wonders if the voidsent drew the Lambs to Amdapor in the first place, before dismissing such theories as improbable. He nevertheless thanks you for restoring peace to the Shroud."

56,"TEXT_SUBCTS109_00430_ADESTAN_000_032","Well met, my friend! I am here at A–Ruhn–Senna's behest to investigate the keep. You are here because of my findings: terrible things fester within those ruins, and someone must destroy them!"
57,"TEXT_SUBCTS109_00430_ADESTAN_000_033","Yes, even though the Lambs of Dalamud─and their dealings with voidsent─plague us no longer, the fell presence hanging over the place grows stronger by the day."
58,"TEXT_SUBCTS109_00430_ADESTAN_000_034","Wood Wailers ventured into the keep to find the cause. Their reports were chilling: someone has completed the cultists' rituals, and summoned the most ghastly of voidsent. Over them reigns a leader, peerless in might and malice."

71,"TEXT_SUBCTS109_00430_ADESTAN_000_094","Hah! Then I know the truth of it. 'Twas no living soul who brought the voidsent upon us. No, it was the blood of the Lambs of Dalamud, the very same that stains the ground!"
72,"TEXT_SUBCTS109_00430_ADESTAN_000_095","The dark sigils drawn by the cultists must have been finished but for a sacrifice! How ironic, that their own blood should bring the rites to completion."
73,"TEXT_SUBCTS109_00430_ADESTAN_000_096","It was mere coincidence, and nothing more. No sinister forces here conspired, no mortals eagerly beckoned voidsent into our realm. We may put this matter to rest."
74,"TEXT_SUBCTS109_00430_ADESTAN_000_097","...Save for the voidsent lord at the heart of the keep. I had assumed it was an unthinking brute, but from what you said of its manner, mayhap it had cunning aplenty..."
75,"TEXT_SUBCTS109_00430_ADESTAN_100_097","Indeed, this fiend <Emphasis>could</Emphasis> have beguiled the Lambs of Dalamud into all of this. If dark forces are able to so lead mortals, then grim days lie ahead of us."
76,"TEXT_SUBCTS109_00430_ADESTAN_000_098","But such ill musings do not suit your victory. I shall enjoy this respite from danger, as I hope you shall, too. Go well, and rest assured that A–Ruhn–Senna will learn of your valor this day."
