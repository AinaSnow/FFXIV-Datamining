Briardien acquiesces, if only to get his meddling rival out of his hair while he pursues his own line of investigation. Accompany Inspector Hildibrand to the guild to see what information might be had."

Share these frightful findings with Inspector Hildibrand, who is surely eager to put his famed deductive powers to work."

Briardien dismisses this theory out of hand, while granting that the Sil'dih connection is indeed worth exploring. As the consulting inspector ponders the relationship between the murder victims, Ellie shares rumors she heard about a man who was sighted trying to make contact with more than one of the victims while they still lived. Seek out this man, the trader Guguriya of Horizon, to see what stories he may have to tell."

He reveals that the victims were all members of the Arbiters of Truth─a secret society devoted to preventing false knowledge of Ul'dahn history from reaching the ears of the general populace─and that they were turned to zombies before being slain. He further shares with you the identity of his employer, a man by the name of Hob, who─fearing for his life after the murders of his colleagues─has already fled the sultanate. Hurry to Vesper Bay and seek the man out before he meets a similarly gruesome fate."

There is scarcely time to rejoice in this most unexpected and fortunate turn of events when a stumbling Hildibrand accidentally dumps a second sachet of dust on the fallen man's face, removing a second mask to reveal that he is indeed one of Phillice's men, after all. In the meantime, Ellie is nowhere to be found. Phillice is quick to take action, declaring the <Emphasis>Mythril Eye</Emphasis> reporter the phantom thief and sending her full contingent out to secure her arrest.
