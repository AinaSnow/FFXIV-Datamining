You can only hope that the eggs you acquired for the farmer will help contribute to the salvation of this Calamity-ravaged land."

49,"TEXT_SUBSEA108_00405_LYULF_000_2","But if I am to restore Swiftperch to the very same settlement it was when my father was alive, then I must also try my hand at dodo-raising. And, as you have likely surmised, I shall require your adventurer's resourcefulness in this endeavor."
50,"TEXT_SUBSEA108_00405_LYULF_000_3","For the initial stage of my dodo-rearing enterprise, I need you to head into the Flock and seek out dodo nests. You'll be looking for fertilized eggs─three of them should do nicely for now."

54,"TEXT_SUBSEA108_00405_LYULF_000_12","Yes, you did exceptionally well in selecting only fertilized eggs! Now that I consider it, I'm not entirely sure how you managed to tell... In any case, I must raise the naturally aggressive dodo from the egg if I am to have any chance of surviving the breeding process."
55,"TEXT_SUBSEA108_00405_LYULF_000_13","Apart from encouraging a more docile behavior while the bird is but a chick, it is imperative that I remove the gland that produces that infamous poisonous breath. My father's notes quite graphically depict the consequences of failing to do so."
