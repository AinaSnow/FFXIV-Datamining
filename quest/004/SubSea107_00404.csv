49,"TEXT_SUBSEA107_00404_LYULF_000_2","All that I have left of my dear old dad is his notebook. He scrawled down a fair bit of nonsense in that ratty, dog-eared tome, but as I was leafing through the pages one day, I found a passage entitled “For the Future.” It described the location where my father had buried his “earthly wealth,” in an area that was once a bustling neighborhood."
50,"TEXT_SUBSEA107_00404_LYULF_000_3","I was not aware our family possessed much in the way of treasures. Could the crafty rapscallion have squirreled away a bulging bag of gil or precious stones?

55,"TEXT_SUBSEA107_00404_LYULF_000_13","Ah! I remember now! He once told me that our family's wheat was as a stubborn weed. It was one of the few crops that could take root in the barren soils of western La Noscea!"
56,"TEXT_SUBSEA107_00404_LYULF_000_14","With these seeds, our lifeless fields could once again sprout golden stalks! Thank you, oh, thank you! You have truly given this settlement the chance to build a new future."
