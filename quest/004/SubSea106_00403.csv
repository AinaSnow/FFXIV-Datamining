7,"TEXT_SUBSEA106_00403_SEQ_07","After hearing your request, Forgemaster H'naanza agrees to have the faulty furnace repaired. The armorer mentions, with some irritation, that the furnace was only just recently fixed. It seems that the bomb trapped inside may have been overly volatile, but could there be another reason for the device's failure...?"
