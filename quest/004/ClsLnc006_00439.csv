Ywain bids you hasten to your comrades' aid, granting you full discretion to use all necessary force if it will serve to prevent further bloodshed."
2,"TEXT_CLSLNC006_00439_SEQ_02","According to the lancer you rescued, Foulques was headed in the direction of the North Shroud. Intercept him before he has the chance to do any more harm."
3,"TEXT_CLSLNC006_00439_SEQ_03","You have prevailed over the deranged Foulques. Take word of his demise to Ywain, who awaits at the Lancers' Guild."
4,"TEXT_CLSLNC006_00439_SEQ_04","For the courage you displayed in defeating Foulques, Ywain declares you ready to master a devastating new technique: Lance Charge. Having learned all you can from your guildmaster, you set your sights upon challenges yet unknown. Keeping your lessons close to heart, go forth and blaze a new trail with lance in hand."
