1,"TEXT_GAIUSE611_00423_SEQ_01","That they might better understand the impact of primal summonings, the Scions of the Seventh Dawn employ scholars to travel across Eorzea taking aetheric readings. These expeditions often entail visiting dangerous areas, and so each scholar is assigned an escort. Unfortunately, an adventurer charged with accompanying one such scholar was recently injured, leaving Minfilia with no other option but to ask that you serve in his stead. Hoary Boulder, who awaits you outside the solar, will brief you on the details."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSE611_00423_SEQ_02","Hoary Boulder welcomes the opportunity to work with you personally─though Coultenet observes that your duties will take you in different directions. Your charge awaits you at Camp Tranquil in the South Shroud. Make your way into the forest and see your mission done."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSE611_00423_SEQ_03","Your late arrival does little to endear you to the scholar, who curtly instructs you to follow him to Issom–Har without further delay."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSE611_00423_SEQ_04","Having found a suitable location, the scholar begins to calibrate his instruments. Leave him to his work and keep watch for wild beasts."
5,"TEXT_GAIUSE611_00423_SEQ_05","A brief moment of action provides a welcome distraction from an otherwise uneventful duty. Speak with the scholar to see if he has finished taking measurements."
6,"TEXT_GAIUSE611_00423_SEQ_06","Rather than express gratitude for your protection, the scholar requests that you make a more concerted effort to slay your assailants quietly. Resist the urge to remind him who he is talking to, and accompany the vile ingrate to Snakemolt so that he might continue his mission."
7,"TEXT_GAIUSE611_00423_SEQ_07","The scholar wastes no time preparing to take measurements, and orders you to stand watch as before."
8,"TEXT_GAIUSE611_00423_SEQ_08","You dispatch your assailants with practiced efficiency. With luck, the scholar will have no complaints this time."
9,"TEXT_GAIUSE611_00423_SEQ_09","Suddenly disconcerted by the atmosphere in Snakemolt, the scholar hurriedly departs for Rootslake, where the final survey site awaits. Follow him and complete your mission."
10,"TEXT_GAIUSE611_00423_SEQ_10","His words terse and his mood tense, the scholar motions for you to stand guard once more."
11,"TEXT_GAIUSE611_00423_SEQ_11","The attack comes as little surprise, as does your victory. Inform the scholar that all is well."
12,"TEXT_GAIUSE611_00423_SEQ_12","Apparently unconvinced by your assertion that all is well, the scholar flees the lingering stench of slaughter for the relative safety of Camp Tranquil."
13,"TEXT_GAIUSE611_00423_SEQ_13","After a cursory analysis, the scholar concludes that there has been a widespread decrease in ambient aether concentrations following the Calamity. However, as his results are far from conclusive, he deems it necessary to take further measurements─accompanied, presumably, by you..."
