1,"TEXT_GAIUSE607_00419_SEQ_01","Ser Marcelain explains that the damage Iceheart inflicted on Ishgard's arcane barrier has allowed the dragons to land directly upon the Steps of Faith─the bridge which spans the Sea of Clouds between the Gates of Judgement and the city proper. You are to take up position on the Steps of Faith, and aid the Temple Knights in defending the vital structure against the Dravanian Horde.

※The Steps of Faith can be accessed via the Duty Finder."

4,"TEXT_GAIUSE607_00419_SEQ_04","Moments after greeting Alphinaud, you are joined by a grateful Ser Aymeric, who humbly thanks you for your service. When the lord commander subsequently takes his leave, Alphinaud triumphantly declares that the stage has been set for Ishgard's return to the Eorzean Alliance. Make your way back to Revenant's Toll, and report your success to Minfilia."

49,"TEXT_GAIUSE607_00419_MARCELAIN_000_001","More than simply a means to cross the Sea of Clouds, the bridge serves as a foundation for the arcane wards that form the barrier we call Daniffen's Collar."
50,"TEXT_GAIUSE607_00419_MARCELAIN_000_002","Alas, in dispelling the barrier's outermost layer, that thrice-damned witch Iceheart stripped the bridge of its protection, and thus are the dragons now able to land unhindered upon the Steps of Faith."
51,"TEXT_GAIUSE607_00419_MARCELAIN_000_003","Should the Dravanians succeed in destroying the remainder of the wards, the winged devils will be free to swarm within the city itself."
