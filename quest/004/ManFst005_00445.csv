Named Yda and Papalymo, respectively, the pair are scholars who are assisting the Gods' Quiver and the Wood Wailers. That revelation aside, your efforts have helped shed some light on the Ixal's recent activities. Galfrid expresses his gratitude, and asks that you continue to labor in service of Gridania and her citizens."
