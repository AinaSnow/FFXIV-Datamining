1,"TEXT_GAIUSE608_00420_SEQ_01","Though she had hoped to grant you some respite after your exertions in Ishgard, an unexpected invitation from Ul'dah compels Minfilia to beg your assistance once more. A feast is being held to celebrate Ishgard's victory, and it would seem the Scions are expected to attend. Though Tataru wastes no time making the necessary arrangements, her uncharacteristic sighs tell Minfilia that something is amiss. Look for the troubled receptionist at her desk outside the solar."

3,"TEXT_GAIUSE608_00420_SEQ_03","F'lhaminn informs you that Tataru recently left through the front door of the Rising Stones, sighing as she went. Head out into Revenant's Toll and search for the receptionist."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSE608_00420_SEQ_04","You find Tataru alone, grappling with a problem she feels unable to share. After drawing encouragement from your stoic presence, however, she decides to bring the issue to the Antecedent. Return to the Rising Stones and speak with Minfilia."
5,"TEXT_GAIUSE608_00420_SEQ_05","Citing a need for some measure of martial prowess, Tataru requests a leave of absence to study her chosen discipline. Just as the determined Lalafell is departing, Hoary Boulder arrives to petition the Antecedent with a request of his own. It would seem that the adventurer assigned to his escort party has been seriously injured, leaving them in need of a replacement guard..."

50,"TEXT_GAIUSE608_00420_TATARU_000_002","A messenger from Ul'dah arrived with a missive for you."

54,"TEXT_GAIUSE608_00420_MINFILIA_000_006","It would seem we are to be recognized for our part in lifting the siege─you, for your valiant efforts as commander of the adventurers' contingent, and the Archons for their earnest attempts to rouse the city–states."
55,"TEXT_GAIUSE608_00420_MINFILIA_000_007","Truly, I find it strange that the Alliance leaders should think themselves deserving of a place at such a celebration."
56,"TEXT_GAIUSE608_00420_MINFILIA_000_008","All three refused to deploy their standing armies, preferring to send hastily assembled companies of sellswords, many of whom perished ere the siege began. Are they truly so brazen as to seek to share in the glory of your triumph?"
57,"TEXT_GAIUSE608_00420_MINFILIA_000_009","Ah, but mayhap they simply seek a pretext to meet with the Ishgardians while the mood is yet jubilant... Such an occasion would present a fine opportunity to press for Ishgard's return to the Eorzean Alliance."

82,"TEXT_GAIUSE608_00420_MINFILIA_000_070","Ah, not at present, thank you. ...Was there something you would ask of me?"
83,"TEXT_GAIUSE608_00420_HOARYBOULDER_000_071","Oh, yes! Pray excuse my distraction. An adventurer who was to join us for escort duty was injured while out on patrol."
84,"TEXT_GAIUSE608_00420_HOARYBOULDER_000_072","And I fear we cannot properly defend the scholars entrusted to our protection without the aid of at least one more guard..."
85,"TEXT_GAIUSE608_00420_HOARYBOULDER_000_073","Therefore, I humbly request that another adventurer─of the capable kind, of course─be assigned to our party."
