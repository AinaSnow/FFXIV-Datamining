Concerned that something may be amiss with the elementals, he has committed the details of his sightings to parchment, and bids you deliver the document to Miounne."
2,"TEXT_MANFST006_00446_SEQ_02","Miounne's face turns deathly pale as she reads Luquelot's letter. It would seem trouble is brewing, and that your aid is needed once more. Prepare yourself for a mission of grave import, and then request further orders from Miounne."

The frequency, however, does not bother me near so much as <Emphasis>where</Emphasis> they choose to fly─the patch of sky directly above the Guardian Tree."
50,"TEXT_MANFST006_00446_LUQUELOT_000_3","The tree is a sacred site, or so I was given to believe when first I came to Gridania, and thus I naturally assumed that the elementals would not suffer the Ixal to profane it. Yet the birdmen have been coming and going as they please, with nary a sign of protest from the guardians of the Twelveswood."
51,"TEXT_MANFST006_00446_LUQUELOT_000_4","And it was that which set me to thinking... Ever since the appearance of the much-talked-about “suspicious individual,” many and more strange things have been occurring in the forest. Could it be that he did something to the elementals?"
