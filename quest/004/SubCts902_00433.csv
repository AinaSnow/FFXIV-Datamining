1,"TEXT_SUBCTS902_00433_SEQ_01","The elder primal Odin has reared his head again. This time, however, Brother O–App–Pesi has devised a strategy to put an end to the Dark Divinity's hunt through the Shroud. He has personally asked for your aid, and has called for you to attend him in Urth's Fount."
2,"TEXT_SUBCTS902_00433_SEQ_02","O–App–Pesi wastes no words─you are to head a company of adventurers against the Dark Divinity. The brother and E–Sumi–Yan will behold your battle with Odin from afar in hopes of learning why the primal is never long gone from the Shroud. When you are ready, proceed to Urth's Fount and challenge Odin.

※Urth's Fount can be accessed via the Duty Finder."
3,"TEXT_SUBCTS902_00433_SEQ_03","The Dark Divinity rides no more. Speak with O–App–Pesi and learn what he has observed."
4,"TEXT_SUBCTS902_00433_SEQ_04","The two brothers present a fascinating theory: Odin is not the being who wields the Zantetsuken, but rather a manifestation of the blade itself. Before they are able to study the sword further, however, a sworn man of the Gods' Quiver steals the Zantetsuken. O–App–Pesi vows you will get the chance to shatter the fell blade on the day the sword is again found."

53,"TEXT_SUBCTS902_00433_OAPPPESI_000_011","As you know, Odin hunts in this forest. We would banish him from the Shroud. Yet in actual fact, he has fallen before countless adventurers already. By all rights, the primal should plague us no more."
54,"TEXT_SUBCTS902_00433_OAPPPESI_000_012","Yet, though again and again he is vanquished, he rises always to charge through the Twelveswood. His constant reappearance is perplexing to say the least, and raises two questions: who summons him, and how does he change his visage upon manifesting?"
55,"TEXT_SUBCTS902_00433_OAPPPESI_000_013","Odin is alone amongst the primals in these aspects. Indeed, I can find not a single sentence in the scriptures that sheds light on his devilish abilities."
56,"TEXT_SUBCTS902_00433_OAPPPESI_000_014","There is no answer in words writ of the pen. Now, the sword must serve. Our plan is to send a band of adventurers against the Dark Divinity. Brother E–Sumi–Yan, my master, and I will observe the battle from afar."

58,"TEXT_SUBCTS902_00433_OAPPPESI_000_016","Naturally, this hinges upon the company's victory. No one but a Warrior of Light could hope to survive the battle. Hence, I have asked you here."

65,"TEXT_SUBCTS902_00433_ESUMIYAN_000_023","Adventurer, I would offer you thanks for all you have done today. I am E–Sumi–Yan, master of the Conjurers' Guild."
66,"TEXT_SUBCTS902_00433_ESUMIYANI_000_024","Ah, but no doubt you are keen to learn more of the Dark Divinity. Very well. I shall share with you what I have gleaned in observing your battle."
67,"TEXT_SUBCTS902_00433_ESUMIYANI_100_024","To begin, felling a primal allows the aether of their physical manifestation to return to the land─this much you know, yes?"
68,"TEXT_SUBCTS902_00433_OAPPPESI_000_025","Odin seems to be subject to the selfsame laws. Yet his sword, the Zantetsuken, remains even after his body vanishes. Thus, we thought to examine the blade, and in so doing, found that its aetheric density is unimaginably high!"
69,"TEXT_SUBCTS902_00433_ESUMIYANI_000_026","Now, we had always assumed the being who brandished the weapon was Odin. But what if we erred? What if the sword Zantetsuken is, in and of itself, the Dark Divinity? An unforeseen conclusion, yes, but one that clarifies much of the primal."
70,"TEXT_SUBCTS902_00433_OAPPPESI_000_027","Indeed, that would explain why Odin has never truly fallen─no one has thought to destroy the blade. And if the Zantetsuken is the primal, could it not conjure itself a new wielder?"
71,"TEXT_SUBCTS902_00433_ESUMIYANI_000_028","Yet, just as Ifrit's tempered or Leviathan's drowned, Odin must needs have his “sundered” to offer crystals in his name─<Emphasis>unless</Emphasis> he drinks of the Shroud's aether. Such a weak source of power could be why it takes time for the Dark Divinity to manifest again."
72,"TEXT_SUBCTS902_00433_OAPPPESI_000_029","You see, adventurer, our theory accounts quite nicely for <Emphasis>two</Emphasis> of the mysteries that for so long surrounded the primal."
73,"TEXT_SUBCTS902_00433_ESUMIYANI_000_030","And yet, as O–App–Pesi hints, a third mystery remains: if there are no sundered, how does Odin sustain himself? I cannot imagine the wishes of those who first summoned him were so strong as to echo throughout the centuries."
74,"TEXT_SUBCTS902_00433_OAPPPESI_000_031","Brother, I do not think our theory is flawed. No, this discovery makes clear the holes in what we had for so long believed of the primals. We must revisit the beings with a keener eye."
75,"TEXT_SUBCTS902_00433_OAPPPESI_000_032","I will inform Master Urianger of what we have gleaned here. Adventurer, I urge you to do the same should something else of Odin occur to you."
76,"TEXT_SUBCTS902_00433_OAPPPESI_000_033","But today is a victory, all the same. We have the Zantetsuken, and the mysteries that remain pale in import to the act of locking the primal away. With any luck, we can seal the sword and end the Dark Divinity's ride."
77,"TEXT_SUBCTS902_00433_LEWIN_100_033","Brothers! Something terrible has happened!"
78,"TEXT_SUBCTS902_00433_LEWIN_000_034","The Zantetsuken is gone! One of my own men has stolen away with the blade, and left nary a trace to track his flight. I never dreamt he would do such a thing, and I stayed my hand too long to stop him..."
79,"TEXT_SUBCTS902_00433_OAPPPESI_000_035","What!? Are your men so disloyal as to rob you!? Tell me, Lewin, why would someone do such a thing!?"
80,"TEXT_SUBCTS902_00433_LEWIN_000_036","Forgive me, Brother, but I cannot say. I am as astonished as you. The thief was a sworn man of Gods' Quiver, true as any Gridanian arrow. Moreover, what could he stand to gain by stealing so fell a blade?"
81,"TEXT_SUBCTS902_00433_ESUMIYANI_000_037","Mayhap the soul of the thief was stolen along with the blade. It is within the power of all primals to bend mortals to their wills. If the Zantetsuken and Odin are one and the same, then the sword may control the now-sundered man. Is that not right, Brother?"
82,"TEXT_SUBCTS902_00433_OAPPPESI_000_038","That...that is indeed possible. Gods, could I have been so blind as that?"
83,"TEXT_SUBCTS902_00433_OAPPPESI_100_038","Bowlord Lewin, it is I who needs apologize. Had I been more wary, I would have foreseen this. Instead, I have cost us dearly, and placed you and your men in great danger..."
84,"TEXT_SUBCTS902_00433_ESUMIYANI_000_039","Let us not cry over lost swords. Bowlord Lewin, send forth the Gods' Quiver and Wood Wailers to scour the Shroud. Brother O–App–Pesi and I will devote ourselves to devising a way to fell Odin after the Zantetsuken is ours again."
85,"TEXT_SUBCTS902_00433_OAPPPESI_000_040","...Yes, Brother. Indeed, it would be a poor thing to have the blade in our grasp, and no way to destroy it nor dull its bite."
86,"TEXT_SUBCTS902_00433_OAPPPESI_100_040","Adventurer, I will call upon you again when we have something to show for our efforts. Until then, go in peace."
87,"TEXT_SUBCTS902_00433_SCARLET_000_041","Word of your battle with Odin has traveled quickly. Toppling the Dark Divinity is no small feat, after all."
88,"TEXT_SUBCTS902_00433_SCARLET_000_042","Needless to say, Brother O–App–Pesi will wish to discuss your victory. Pray report to him in Urth's Fount with all due haste."
