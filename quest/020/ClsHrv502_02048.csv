1,"TEXT_CLSHRV502_02048_SEQ_01","No sooner do you begin conversing with Fufucha than you are interrupted by one Mujih Mewrilah, a reporter from <Emphasis>The Raven</Emphasis>. Apparently, Mujih is planning a series of articles, for which she seeks the guild's permission to follow the doings of a first-rate botanist. With none of your peers available who fit the bill, Fufucha recommends you as the subject for Mujih's story. At the same time, she bids you answer a call for aid from faraway Ishgard, which comes through your friend and colleague Roiteloin. Take the letter of introduction Fufucha has given you, and deliver it to Roiteloin at Skyfire Locks."
2,"TEXT_CLSHRV502_02048_SEQ_02","Roiteloin assures you that a letter of introduction is unnecessary to vouch for your ability, and goes on to share with you the particulars of the call for aid. The petitioner is a botanist named Basyle, who is stationed at Camp Cloudtop in the Sea of Clouds. Roiteloin will arrange for you to meet him at the aetheryte plaza in Foundation; make your way there and join Mujih Mewrilah ahead of time."
3,"TEXT_CLSHRV502_02048_SEQ_03","You speak with Basyle, who informs you of his work at Camp Cloudtop. He labors to alleviate the outpost's reliance on supplies being shipped in, but his attempts to raise crops thus far have met with little success. It is his hope that your abundant knowledge and skilled hands will serve to aid his cause. Before taking his leave, Basyle promises to send requests to you by way of Mujih.

※The next botanist quest will be available from Mujih Mewrilah upon reaching level 53."
