1,"TEXT_CLSMIN530_02081_SEQ_01","House Fortemps has asked that Oschon's Raiders survey the Coerthas western highlands. They are interested in the mythrite that may lie beneath the region. Haimirich therefore tasks you with discovering whether or not a sufficient quantity of pure ore can be pulled from underground. With your marching orders now set, Haimirich bids you join him and his men to the south end of the Black Iron Bridge."
2,"TEXT_CLSMIN530_02081_SEQ_02","You find Oschon's Raiders idling near the south end of the bridge. However, all jump to attention when Haimirich calls, and they listen attentively as he gives them their individual orders. Finally, he comes to you, and tells you to find ten chunks of high-quality mythrite ore in the area. Begin your search at the mineral deposits near the Gorgagne Holding, and return to Haimirich with your findings when finished."
3,"TEXT_CLSMIN530_02081_SEQ_03","Haimirich gladly accepts the mythrite ore just before Hatchling comes running with ill tidings─one of the Raiders has been injured. The Raider captain wastes no time in sending the man to Falcon's Nest for treatment, and then treats you and Hatchling to his thoughts on being a sellsword before returning to the Forgotten Knight. Meet with him there when you head back to Ishgard."
4,"TEXT_CLSMIN530_02081_SEQ_04","According to Haimirich, the wounded Raider will make a full recovery. He thanks you again, and bids you make yourself ready for when the next job comes down from House Fortemps.

※The next miner quest will be available from Haimirich upon reaching level 55."

56,"TEXT_CLSMIN530_02081_HEIMIRICH_000_042","Professor, start diggin' for mythrite down by the Gorgagne Holdin'. Come back here when you've pulled a few bits o' quality ore out the ground."
