1,"TEXT_CLSCUL502_02043_SEQ_01","An acquaintance of Lyngsath's requires the services of a consummate culinarian, and the guildmaster believes that you are the <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If> for the job. If the prospect of a new challenge piques your interest, head over to the Missing Member and present yourself to the head waitress, one Melkoko."
2,"TEXT_CLSCUL502_02043_SEQ_02","In the same breath, Melkoko introduces herself and informs you of the task she would have you undertake: participating in the Dellemont d'Or, the most prestigious of all cooking contests. The winner of the previous edition, she reveals, is none other than the Missing Member's head chef, a man named H'mhasi Tia, of whom she is none too fond. She bids you speak with the fellow inside the tavern, that you might understand her aversion towards him."
3,"TEXT_CLSCUL502_02043_SEQ_03","A moment with H'mhasi Tia is all it takes for you to appreciate Melkoko's sentiments. But whatever else the man may be, he is supremely confident of winning the Dellemont d'Or for a second consecutive time. Return to Melkoko and report the details of the encounter to her."
4,"TEXT_CLSCUL502_02043_SEQ_04","With H'mhasi Tia's detestable personality thus established, Melkoko reveals to you her motive for having you enter the Dellemont d'Or: she wants you to beat the arrogant culinarian and put him in his place. Whether or not you share her enthusiasm for poetic justice, you are bound to gain something by pitting your skills against other culinarians.

※The next culinarian quest will be available from Melkoko upon reaching level 53."
