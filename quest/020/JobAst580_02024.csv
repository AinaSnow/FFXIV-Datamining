2,"TEXT_JOBAST580_02024_SEQ_02","The knights in Hemlock find themselves locked in a heated battle with a pack of terrible winged creatures. Without aid for their injured companions, that battle will surely be lost."

6,"TEXT_JOBAST580_02024_SEQ_06","You rescue Leveva and Jannequinard from several hungry creatures, only to have your warm reunion cut short by the arrival of Sevestre─the high-ranking Sharlayan official who hired Celie to capture Leveva. Sevestre has detained Leveva's ailing grandfather and tells her that if she wishes him released, she must return with him to the Old World."
7,"TEXT_JOBAST580_02024_SEQ_07","Leveva has gleaned from her father's journal that Sevestre was the mastermind behind Rufin's murder. Apparently, the Bibliothecs' leader sought to make the assassination look like an Ishgardian attack in order to strengthen his argument for abandoning Eorzea. Unfortunately, the journal─and the evidence it contains─now lies in the hands of he whom it would condemn. Jannequinard wishes to return to Ishgard so that you may discuss your options, but you should first report to the House Durendaire knight captain and see if he has further need of your services."
8,"TEXT_JOBAST580_02024_SEQ_08","The knight thanks you for your assistance and has nothing but praise for your efforts. You may now return to Ishgard with Jannequinard, Quimperain, and Leveva."
9,"TEXT_JOBAST580_02024_SEQ_09","Leveva has decided to surrender herself to Sevestre and quietly return with the man to Sharlayan so that no harm may come to her grandfather and mother. Jannequinard has agreed to escort her to the abandoned Sharlayan city–state in the Dravanian hinterlands, despite the fact his life may also be in danger.

※The next astrologian quest will be available from Jannequinard upon reaching level 60."

The operation is small enough and far enough away from the capital that even if it is a success, no one will pay it half a mind, but the Vault will be able to say that they answered the pleas of the knights.
