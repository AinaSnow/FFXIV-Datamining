As you grow more accustomed to drawing upon your darkside, you will come to hear the voice more clearly. Such are Fray's words to you when you ask <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If> of the voice. Communion will hasten this process, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>she<Else/>he</If> continues─but it cannot be conducted in Ishgard. Journey with Fray to Little Ala Mhigo in southern Thanalan."

9,"TEXT_JOBDRK350_02055_SEQ_09","In the abyss, a wanderer's voice sings to you. Forever moving, without rest or respite... Though its meaning yet eludes you, Fray tells you not to be discouraged, further adding that it might belong to an individual whom you are fated to seek out. If so, none can say how long it might take to find them...but the mere thought of the journey stirs something within you...
