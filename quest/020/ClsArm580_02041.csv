1,"TEXT_CLSARM580_02041_SEQ_01","Blanstyr informs you that he has received another commission from Benathaire. Occupied as he is with his training under H'naanza, however, the veteran armorer would have you undertake the task in his stead. Find Benathaire at the Drowning Wench, and learn the details of this latest request."
2,"TEXT_CLSARM580_02041_SEQ_02","Benathaire confides that his party has had little luck in finding a replacement for Wannmaga. In order to expedite the recruitment process, the conjurer would have you forge a shield that he means to offer as a bonus to potential applicants. Unsure of the type of shield that would interest a gladiator, however, Benathaire asks that you consult with their former party member. Travel to the Gates of Judgement in the Coerthas central highlands, and seek out Wannmaga."
3,"TEXT_CLSARM580_02041_SEQ_03","You find Wannmaga pacing before the Gates of Judgement, complaining that he has been denied entry to the city. The Fury-smitten gladiator promises to answer any and all shield-related queries on the condition that you complete his planned devotions. Enter Ishgard, and /pray before the statue of Halone in Saint Reymanaud's Cathedral."
4,"TEXT_CLSARM580_02041_SEQ_04","You make your way to the back of the vast cathedral and perform the required devotions before the towering statue of the Fury. Return to the Gates of Judgement and report to Wannmaga."
5,"TEXT_CLSARM580_02041_SEQ_05","You return to Wannmaga, and assure him that Halone has heard his prayers. The gladiator then shares with you his idea of the perfect shield─light, sturdy, and preferably made of titanium. Forge a high-quality hoplon based on Wannmaga's preferences, and deliver the item to Benathaire at the Drowning Wench."
6,"TEXT_CLSARM580_02041_SEQ_06","You deliver the shield to Benathaire, and he leaves to post a recruitment notice. A short while later, Wannmaga appears, lured by the promise of a titanium hoplon. He and the conjurer immediately begin arguing, but eventually resolve their conflict. Touched by their reunion, a much-changed Blanstyr then arranges to equip the companions with brand-new armor, as part of his new “customer first” philosophy. Continue working alongside the reformed armorer, and take your craft to new heights.

※The next armorer quest will be available from Blanstyr upon reaching level 60."
