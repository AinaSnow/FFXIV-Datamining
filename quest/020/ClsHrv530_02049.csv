1,"TEXT_CLSHRV530_02049_SEQ_01","In excited tones, Mujih informs you that Basyle has sent word of your very first task. Make your way to Camp Cloudtop in the Sea of Clouds, and ask the botanist what he requires of you."
2,"TEXT_CLSHRV530_02049_SEQ_02","The supply situation is grim at Camp Cloudtop, and Basyle begs your advice on a suitable crop to cultivate. Based on your response, he decides to try his luck on cyclops onions, which grow wild in the Dravanian forelands. Gather ten bulbs of the onion and bring them to Basyle."
3,"TEXT_CLSHRV530_02049_SEQ_03","You have delivered ten cyclops onions to Basyle, who declares that he will try growing them in the test plot. Satisfied that she has sufficient material for her first article, Mujih returns to Ishgard. Make your own way back and join her at the aetheryte plaza."
4,"TEXT_CLSHRV530_02049_SEQ_04","With evident pleasure, Mujih informs you that the first installment of her story will soon grace an edition of <Emphasis>The Raven</Emphasis>. As before, she will remain in Ishgard to await further instructions from Basyle.

※The next botanist quest will be available from Mujih Mewrilah upon reaching level 55."

51,"TEXT_CLSHRV530_02049_BASYLE_000_020","My thanks for coming on such short notice. To begin with, I'd like to ask your advice on crops that would thrive in this environment."
52,"TEXT_CLSHRV530_02049_BASYLE_000_021","Right now, our principal crop is a strain of pumpkin native to these isles. With some experimentation, we've succeeded in cultivating it."
53,"TEXT_CLSHRV530_02049_BASYLE_000_022","Unfortunately, hardly anything else grows that's a viable food source. It has something to do with the ratio of wind- to earth-aspected aether up here. There's a much higher concentration of the former, you see, and hardly any of the latter."
54,"TEXT_CLSHRV530_02049_BASYLE_000_023","Gysahl greens are just about the only other thing that has worked out, and these aren't the same as what we have in Coerthas, either. It may interest you to know that the seeds came to us from Gridania, from the Botanists' Guild."
55,"TEXT_CLSHRV530_02049_BASYLE_000_024","Roiteloin urged me to give them a try, and lo and behold, they cropped up like weeds. Strange things do happen, eh?"
56,"TEXT_CLSHRV530_02049_BASYLE_000_025","But in the end, gysahl greens are fit only for chocobos, and what little I'm managing to grow at the moment doesn't make up for the shortfall of supplies."
57,"TEXT_CLSHRV530_02049_BASYLE_000_026","If we're to keep feeding the garrison, we need to find more crops that grow, and set about growing them as soon as possible, or soon we'll all be supping on bird fodder. And so I'd like to ask your opinion: in selecting a crop, what quality is the most critical?"

61,"TEXT_CLSHRV530_02049_BASYLE_000_030","I see... In that case, we might try our luck with onions."
62,"TEXT_CLSHRV530_02049_BASYLE_000_040","I see... In that case, we might try a plant that's native to highland regions."
63,"TEXT_CLSHRV530_02049_BASYLE_000_050","Ah, that reminds me! A hunter I spoke with recently mentioned having seen wild onions in the Dravanian forelands!"
64,"TEXT_CLSHRV530_02049_BASYLE_000_051","Cyclops onions, they're called, and I fancy our chances of cultivating them. If we succeed, they would make a welcome addition to our rations. I'd be grateful if you could gather and bring me ten bulbs of the best specimens you can find."
65,"TEXT_CLSHRV530_02049_BASYLE_000_060","Have you gathered the cyclops onions? They can be found growing wild in the Dravanian forelands."
66,"TEXT_CLSHRV530_02049_BASYLE_000_070","My, they're far larger than I had dared hope! My thanks, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I shall try growing them in our test plot right away."
67,"TEXT_CLSHRV530_02049_MUJIHMEWRILAH_000_071","A test plot, you say?"
68,"TEXT_CLSHRV530_02049_BASYLE_000_072","That's right, miss. Before we grow something in earnest, we need to make certain that it won't be a detriment to other crops."
69,"TEXT_CLSHRV530_02049_BASYLE_000_073","Though sustenance is important, so too is sustainability. If we don't think ahead, we're liable to damage the environment, and that would leave us with nothing."
