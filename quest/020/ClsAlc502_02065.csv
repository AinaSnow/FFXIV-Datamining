1,"TEXT_CLSALC502_02065_SEQ_01","The guildmaster has a task of the utmost importance for you, his favorite assistant─delivering a report of some kind to someone in Revenant's Toll. As Severian has been rather light on details, speak with Deitrich to ascertain the who, what, and why."
2,"TEXT_CLSALC502_02065_SEQ_02","Deitrich─unsurprised that the guildmaster has foisted the delivery onto you─explains that the intended recipient is one Wiltwaek. A member of the Adventurers' Guild charged with keeping the peace, Wiltwaek is currently investigating a crime in Mor Dhona. Some evidence left behind at the scene demanded Guildmaster Severian's expert eye, and the results of his analysis are what you must take to Revenant's Toll. Make your way there now with the certificate of appraisement."
3,"TEXT_CLSALC502_02065_SEQ_03","You meet with Wiltwaek and his trusty companion Chanene. They inform you that a string of mysterious disappearances has plagued Revenant's Toll of late. Wiltwaek opens the certificate of appraisement and exclaims that alchemy is involved in these crimes. He further pronounces that you are to be his consultant on the case. Mystified, you listen as he reads aloud a note from Guildmaster Severian, praising you to the high heavens. As your expertise may not be needed at present, Wiltwaek bids you wait for further developments.

※The next alchemist quest will be available from Wiltwaek upon reaching level 53."
