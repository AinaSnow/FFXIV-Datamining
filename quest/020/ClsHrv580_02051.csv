1,"TEXT_CLSHRV580_02051_SEQ_01","A fretful Mujih informs you that Basyle's crops are under threat from a plague of vermin. Make haste to Camp Cloudtop and see how you can assist the beleaguered botanist."
2,"TEXT_CLSHRV580_02051_SEQ_02","Though an alchemical concoction would deal with the pests in short order, Basyle is loath to employ such an extreme measure for fear of its impact on the environment. To that end, he begs you to consult Martineau once more, in hopes that he will know of a nature-friendly solution. Seek out the herbalist in Saint Reymanaud's Cathedral."
3,"TEXT_CLSHRV580_02051_SEQ_03","Martineau is impressed by your determination to place nature first, and advises you that birch tar has vermin-repelling properties. The substance will have the greatest effect if extracted from logs gathered in the selfsame region that the pests inhabit. Gather ten birch logs in the Sea of Clouds and deliver them to Basyle."
4,"TEXT_CLSHRV580_02051_SEQ_04","Basyle thanks you for the birch logs, and expresses his frustration at being powerless to uphold his own beliefs and serve nature's best interests. In closing, he bids you pass along his thanks to Mujih for her concern. Join the reporter at the aetheryte plaza in Ishgard."
5,"TEXT_CLSHRV580_02051_SEQ_05","In spite of her claims to the contrary, you are convinced that Mujih's interest in Basyle's efforts has become personal. Her added expectation serves to stoke the fires of your desire to succeed.

※The next botanist quest will be available from Mujih Mewrilah upon reaching level 60."

54,"TEXT_CLSHRV580_02051_BASYLE_000_011","An alchemical concoction would deal with them quickly enough, but it's like to harm all creatures indiscriminately. What's more, there's no telling what other effects it might have on the environment."
