1,"TEXT_CLSTAN600_02079_SEQ_01","Elde has her sights set upon a great commission─leather armor for the Temple Knights. You learn that Ortefauchel is in fact a member of the order, and has himself petitioned for lighter, more flexible armor. However, the tradition of using plate mail is deeply rooted, and no one man can overcome it. Unsure of how to proceed, Elde bids you return to the Leatherworkers' Guild with a letter, and pick Geva's brain over how to sell her idea."
2,"TEXT_CLSTAN600_02079_SEQ_02","Geva's general feeling about your current conundrum is that you ought to know how to market leather armor by this point. Nevertheless, she tells you the tale of one Ciceroix Pondefout. This Ishgardian craftsman worked with the guildmaster several generations back to create the leather-hardening process still used in Wood Wailer and Gods' Quiver armor. Armed with this hopefully useful story, return to Elde along the Jeweled Crozier."
3,"TEXT_CLSTAN600_02079_SEQ_03","You find Elde about to discuss raising the issue of leather armor with the Temple Knights. When your turn comes to chime in, you mention Ciceroix Pondefout, and learn this was none other than Elde's grandfather. The artisan had once tried to sell leather armor to the order, but failed and left for Gridania. Elde remembers that she has one old design of his─a chivalric longcoat of aiming─and asks that you fashion this hardy armor now.

50,"TEXT_CLSTAN600_02079_ELDE_000_002","With a commission of great size: armor for the Temple Knights! Until now, the Holy See's own craftsmen made all of it. But not any longer!"
51,"TEXT_CLSTAN600_02079_ORTEFAUCHEL_000_003","Strange you should mention that, actually. There are calls within the order to create a more mobile band of knights. They ought to be discussing what armor will let them move swiftly and silently."
52,"TEXT_CLSTAN600_02079_ELDE_000_004","Aha! If they choose leather, just <Emphasis>think</Emphasis> of the rewards we shall reap!

56,"TEXT_CLSTAN600_02079_ORTEFAUCHEL_000_006","Which is partially because I am charged with supplying the order. I've been looking into leather armor, and have heartily suggested it. But I'm alone in saying so, and my voice carries little weight."

59,"TEXT_CLSTAN600_02079_ELDE_000_008","...Well, I'd anticipated some opposition. I drew up a letter to ask Guildmaster Geva's advice on selling leather armor. Could you take it to her and explain the situation, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>?"

63,"TEXT_CLSTAN600_02079_GEVA_000_021","Well, it sounds as if you've used your time well enough. And getting a commission from the Temple Knights would be a feather in Elde's cap."
64,"TEXT_CLSTAN600_02079_GEVA_000_022","However, I don't see why you need my help selling this idea. You know leather armor is light and flexible. The knights likewise know plate mail is heavy and stiff. That should be enough."
65,"TEXT_CLSTAN600_02079_GEVA_000_023","If the order is choosing metal because they think it protects them better, then you provide them proof to the contrary. Simple, no?"
66,"TEXT_CLSTAN600_02079_GEVA_000_024","Ah, and should they want precedence, tell them of Ciceroix Pondefout. He was a leatherworker who visited from the Holy See in the time of my grandfather."

75,"TEXT_CLSTAN600_02079_ORTEFAUCHEL_100_043","A good point, Gerhardt. It's cold now, and like to get colder. Wearing woolen tunics underneath plate mail is a cumbersome affair. Leather armor offers more warmth, and greater ease of movement. "
76,"TEXT_CLSTAN600_02079_ELDE_000_044","I don't think that alone will be enough, though... <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, what did Guildmaster Geva have to say?"
77,"TEXT_CLSTAN600_02079_ORTEFAUCHEL_000_045","So our ideal armor will be slightly thicker for warmth, and bear the brunt of even a behemoth's attack. But such is possible, yes?"
78,"TEXT_CLSTAN600_02079_GERHARDT_000_046","An <Emphasis>Ishgardian</Emphasis> artisan came up with this, eh? Well, add to that the fact that the Wood Wailers and Gods' Quiver use this technique still, and maybe we'll make the sale."

90,"TEXT_CLSTAN600_02079_ELDE_000_061","Gods above... This armor is more splendid than I could have imagined! Every stitch is careful, precise, and yet it has the same sense of warmth as my grandfather's work."
