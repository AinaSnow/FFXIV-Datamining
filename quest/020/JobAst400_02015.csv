Fortunately, it was your half that was the success. Speak with Leveva again to have her continue the lesson."

Oh, I cannot keep such important news from you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Lady Leveva and Quimperain...just last night they fell victim to another ambush at the hands of bandits!"
49,"TEXT_JOBAST400_02015_JANNEQUINARD_000_001","The ever-resourceful Quimperain proved his invaluable worth once again with a dashing display of chivalry that would shame any knight in the See─a statement that attests to the sorry state of our knights. But that is a chat we can have over a different cup of tea."
50,"TEXT_JOBAST400_02015_JANNEQUINARD_000_002","When Lady Leveva attempted to retire to a room at that filthy inn in the Brume, I had our sorely disused second floor cleared and furnished with trappings from my own home. She is up there now, and asked to see you the moment you arrived."

Anyway, she has asked that you pay her a visit the moment you arrive...which, if this isn't last night's mead talking, is right now."

53,"TEXT_JOBAST400_02015_LEVEVA_000_011","Now, I suppose you are wondering why I summoned you here to these makeshift chambers, and no, it has naught to do with the bandit attacks it appears are much more common in your realm than I thought."

55,"TEXT_JOBAST400_02015_LEVEVA_000_013","So by shuffling a card back into the deck, we are in no way ignoring or denying a future, merely postponing a reading intended for a later date, and replacing it with something that better pertains to the present. I trust that you will pick up this technique swifter than Jannequinard."
