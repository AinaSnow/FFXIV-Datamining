1,"TEXT_JOBMNK560_02029_SEQ_01","O'tchakha has been sighted near Eugenia's Spire. Widargelt means to confront her, that he might learn what drives the sect of shadow. Make haste to the North Shroud and join Widargelt near Eugenia's Spire."
2,"TEXT_JOBMNK560_02029_SEQ_02","You and Widargelt find O'tchakha in a bad way. She explains that her master, a man named H'raha Tia, forced her and D'zentsa to fight one another to the death. Though O'tchakha once saw the man as a father figure, this incident has opened her eyes to his true nature. O'tchakha now fears for D'zentsa, who is still at their master's mercy. She declares her intent to rescue her, and Widargelt pledges his aid. While the two of them make for the safety of the Hedgetree, Widargelt bids you lie in wait near Eugenia's Spire and intercept any pursuers."
3,"TEXT_JOBMNK560_02029_SEQ_03","You have dispatched the minions H'raha Tia had sent to verify O'tchakha's death. Make your way to the Hedgetree and rejoin your companions."
4,"TEXT_JOBMNK560_02029_SEQ_04","O'tchakha reveals the truth of the sect of shadow and the ruthless man who now leads it. Though Widargelt harbors hopes that he and H'raha Tia may yet come to an understanding, O'tchakha is not confident that her master will be amenable to discussion. More than likely, it will come to blows, and against a powerful foe who has opened all fourteen chakra─seven each of light and shadow. For now, return to Revenant's Toll and discuss a course of action with Widargelt."
5,"TEXT_JOBMNK560_02029_SEQ_05","When O'tchakha has recovered, training will resume to open more chakra. In the meantime, Widargelt bids you dedicate yourself to your training, that you might together go forward─as proud disciples of light.

※The next monk quest will be available from Widargelt upon reaching level 58."

84,"TEXT_JOBMNK560_02029_OTCHAKHA_000_160","Recently, I have focused on opening light chakra. Of my own aspect, I have succeeded in opening but six. I am no match for Master H'raha Tia."
