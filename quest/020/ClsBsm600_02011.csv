1,"TEXT_CLSBSM600_02011_SEQ_01","The final round of the grand tournament has come, and Fremondain informs you that Baroness Laurisse is off to a flying start. She has proven herself in the eyes of many spectators, and become a crowd favorite. However, now that she will face the final eight challengers, he fears his mistress needs every advantage. He bids you forge a high-quality adamantite winglet, of the same size and shape as the original Integrity. Do so, that the steward might present a truly fearsome weapon to the baroness.

2,"TEXT_CLSBSM600_02011_SEQ_02","Fremondain gratefully accepts the adamantite winglet, and transfers the sacred bone to the new weapon. Baroness Laurisse joins you, and Fremondain makes to present her the sword. However, in so doing, he reveals that he has not paid you so much as one gil. Taken aback, the baroness refuses the gift─until a few heartfelt words from her loyal steward cause her to change her mind. Yet she will not simply have it for free, and gives you the last remaining valuable of House Jervaint, the cygnine rosary, with the understanding that you will return it in exchange for her winnings in the tournament. Suddenly nervous, Baroness Laurisse leaves to find either great glory or abject failure in the final round. Fremondain bids you follow her to the Lightfeather Proving Grounds, and encourage her if necessary."
3,"TEXT_CLSBSM600_02011_SEQ_03","You find the baroness standing outside of the proving grounds. She is nervous, though she does not admit it in quite so many words. However, your presence allows her to find some measure of confidence, and the splendor of Integrity gives her even more. Thanking you, she turns and goes through the gates, and to whatever fate awaits therein. Join Fremondain in the Jeweled Crozier, and wait for tidings of the daughter of House Jervaint."
4,"TEXT_CLSBSM600_02011_SEQ_04","Baroness Laurisse returns with sad news: she lost in the first bout to an opponent far greater in stature and girth. However, such was her ferocity and bravery that the Temple Knights took notice. Via a messenger, they offer Baroness Laurisse the position of apprentice squire, and praise her valor. The man also inquires into the origin of Integrity, and Baroness Laurisse proudly proclaims it the work of Master <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. You return the cygnine rosary, and take your payment for all the work you have done...finally. The daughter of House Jervaint says that you are doubtless meant for greater things yet, and gives her thanks. You have raised a hero with your creations, and now, the hero will carry your name to new heights.
