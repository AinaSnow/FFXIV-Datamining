0,"TEXT_CLSMIN580_02083_SEQ_00","New orders await you and Oschon's Raiders."
1,"TEXT_CLSMIN580_02083_SEQ_01","Haimirich informs you that your mission today is one of exploration. It appears that your successes have led to further prestige for House Fortemps, and this has agitated old rivalries amongst the nobility. Subsequently, your employers are called upon to do even more, and thus you and Oschon's Raiders have been asked to find out what, if anything, lies beneath the ground of the Makers' Quarter. Make your way to the Dravanian hinterlands and rendezvous with Haimirich."
2,"TEXT_CLSMIN580_02083_SEQ_02","You arrive to find that Haimirich has hired a white-haired naturalist to aid with your survey. Since the area is largely unexplored─by Ishgardians, at any rate─the captain asks that you find three mining points, and see if you can dig up any samples."
3,"TEXT_CLSMIN580_02083_SEQ_03","You have found three samples of some metal unknown to you. Deliver them to Haimirich."
4,"TEXT_CLSMIN580_02083_SEQ_04","Upon examining the samples, the naturalist lets out an astounded cry─all three contain traces of pure hardsilver. The metal is rare and extremely valuable, he tells you. Haimirich is greatly pleased to hear this, and bids you mine ten chunks of high-quality ore. As before, dig at nearby mineral deposits and return to Haimirich with the fruit of your quarrying."
5,"TEXT_CLSMIN580_02083_SEQ_05","While Haimirich is thankful for the hardsilver, he has grown worried about the Dravanians in the surrounding area. However, just before he can sound the retreat, Muscles tells him that Hatchling has chased down some monsters by himself. The boy returns to a furious captain, who berates him for his irresponsibility. With the mood grown somber, Haimirich tells you brusquely to find your own way back to Ishgard. Return to the Holy See, and speak with Haimirich at the Forgotten Knight in hopes that he will be in better spirits."
6,"TEXT_CLSMIN580_02083_SEQ_06","Haimirich regrets his earlier outburst. He admits that he is hard on Hatchling because he sees potential in the boy. Moreover, the captain does not wish him to die as his own brother did. In any case, he bids you await the next job.

※The next miner quest will be available from Haimirich upon reaching level 60."
