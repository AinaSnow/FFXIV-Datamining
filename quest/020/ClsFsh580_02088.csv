1,"TEXT_CLSFSH580_02088_SEQ_01","You walk in on Ansaulme speaking with an elderly Elezen he has known since he was a boy. For many years, the man has happily served as the head chef of Rougecarpe Manor, but his master's recent passing has ushered in a wave of tyranny at the hands of the lord's second son. The new lord regent has demanded to be served a platter of highest-quality letter puffer at his next banquet, a fish thought to be long extinct. Should the chef fail to provide the fish, his life will be forfeit. Ansaulme bids you return to Limsa Lominsa and speak with Sisipu, fount of all fishy knowledge, to see if she has any information as to where the fish might be found."
2,"TEXT_CLSFSH580_02088_SEQ_02","Sisipu's studies lead her to believe that if any letter puffers are extant today, they would be found to the west of Ishgard, in the clouds of Dravania. She suggests you travel to the Churning Mists, and seek further guidance from the local residents."
3,"TEXT_CLSFSH580_02088_SEQ_03","You meet with Mogtoe, who suggests that you speak with Mogukk, the most avid angler in Moghome. He has recently been seen flying north on yet another fishing expedition. Search for Mogukk north of Moghome, and ask if he knows aught of the letter puffers' whereabouts."
4,"TEXT_CLSFSH580_02088_SEQ_04","Mogukk informs you that letter puffers are indeed indigenous to the Churning Mists. A few moons prior, he had the misfortune of catching one of the elusive creatures in the clouds around the Landlord Colony. If you should manage to reel in a high-quality specimen, he would be interested to see it for himself."
5,"TEXT_CLSFSH580_02088_SEQ_05","You show the letter puffer to Mogukk, who is delighted to see such a splendid specimen. As a reward for your efforts, he tells you a tale of a magical floating island, where strange fish swim in pools of aetherochemical effluent, sustaining themselves on a diet of fiend worms. If the tale is true, perhaps these worms could be used to hook the creatures from their peculiar pools? But now is not the time to be thinking of aetherfishing─deliver the letter puffer to Ansaulme before his friend meets an untimely end."
6,"TEXT_CLSFSH580_02088_SEQ_06","Ansaulme gratefully accepts the letter puffer and hands it to his old friend, warning him of its poisonous entrails. However, to the chef's shock, Ansaulme goes on to suggest that he use the fish's venom sac to poison the lord regent. In the ensuing exchange, Ansaulme confesses that the tyrannical regent is in fact his younger brother, making him the rightful heir to House Rougecarpe. He pledges to bring an end to his brother's reign of terror by finally accepting his inheritance. After satisfying his old friend that his travails are nearly over, Ansaulme turns the conversation back to his favorite subject─fish. You tell him how you caught the letter puffer, and the story Mogukk told you in return. To your great surprise, Ansaulme produces a sample of the fiend worms Mogukk spoke of, lending credence to the moogle's outlandish tale. If you should ever find your way to the floating continent, the vilekin would surely make the perfect bait for a spot of aetherfishing.

※The next fisher quest will be available from Ansaulme upon reaching level 60."
