1,"TEXT_CLSMIN502_02080_SEQ_01","Adalberta has received a request for an expert miner from a company of sellswords currently in Ishgard. The guildmaster strongly urges you to pursue the opportunity. If the thought of prospecting in the north calls to you, speak with Linette to obtain the necessary proof of your affiliation."
2,"TEXT_CLSMIN502_02080_SEQ_02","Linette hands over the papers, along with her best wishes for your venture. Take the sooty envelope to a knight stationed in front of Fortemps Manor."
3,"TEXT_CLSMIN502_02080_SEQ_03","Upon realizing who you are, the knight welcomes you to House Fortemps. He informs you that his lord has seen fit to hire foreign sellswords to explore more of Ishgard's territory. You are to join Oschon's Raiders─one such company. Make your way to the Forgotten Knight and speak with Haimirich, the company's captain."
4,"TEXT_CLSMIN502_02080_SEQ_04","Haimirich welcomes you warmly to Oschon's Raiders, and introduces Hatchling, after a fashion. This youngest member of the company clues you in on a tradition of sorts, and gives you the nickname “Professor.” Haimirich bids you wait for the present, as there is no work to be had. However, he asks that you make yourself ready for when it comes.

※The next miner quest will be available from Haimirich upon reaching level 53."

49,"TEXT_CLSMIN502_02080_ADALBERTA_000_001","I know how that sounds, but it's a company that's been charged with doing a mineral survey, and they need an expert's eye. Their captain is an Ul'dahn, too, one who's familiar with the guild's way of doing things."
50,"TEXT_CLSMIN502_02080_ADALBERTA_000_002","Now, Ishgard's territory is untamed and dangerous. But it's worth it to go where no miner has gone before, and I urge you to accept. Linette can supply proof that you're a genuine guild member if you do."
