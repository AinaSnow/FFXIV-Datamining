48,"TEXT_JOBAST500_02018_JANNEQUINARD_000_000","Lady Leveva tells me that you are nearly ready to open the sixth and final gate. Yes. I said final. We all know there are seven heavens, but opening the seventh is impossible...well, except upon death, of course. An attempt to attune to the pole star would be sheer madness and most certainly spell your doom. Ah, but look at me. Even now, attempting to tutor the great <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, when it is obvious your talent far surpasses mine. Forgive me."
49,"TEXT_JOBAST500_02018_JANNEQUINARD_000_001","Lady Leveva has yet to depart for the location of the final gate. Doubtless she fears yet another bandit attack, but whatever the reason, she remains on the second floor and has asked that you visit her at your earliest convenience."
50,"TEXT_JOBAST500_02018_JANNEQUINARD_000_009","Lady Leveva is on the second floor only because she refuses to accept the room I have offered her at Durendaire Manor. It is not as if I would make any untoward attempts at sullying her honor. Having seen but half the summers as I, she is far too young for my tastes."

53,"TEXT_JOBAST500_02018_LEVEVA_000_012","The nocturnal sect contains those celestial bodies ruled by the two moons. I say two, because since the dawn of astrology, disciples of our field have used Dalamud in their readings. Now, even after the false moon's fall, its position...or should I say, its absence, yet has influence over our fates."
54,"TEXT_JOBAST500_02018_LEVEVA_000_013","Whereas the sun and the diurnal stars represent the self, expression, the active─and the moon and the nocturnal stars represent the unconscious, the passive─Dalamud represents, and still does represent the uncontrollable. Its power has the ability to quicken the senses, as well as provide added protection from the unknown─things beneficial when pursuing one's fate."
