1,"TEXT_CLSMIN550_02082_SEQ_01","It seems that House Fortemps will be leading a new push against Dravania, and needs to armor itself for a fierce battle. For this purpose, only titanium will serve. However, it is unclear where ore can be mined in sufficient quantity to fulfill the knights' needs. Haimirich turns to you for an answer, and, given that you do not seem to have one, bids you seek the counsel of your guildmaster. Armed with a sample of titanium, make your way to Ul'dah and see what Adalberta has to say."
2,"TEXT_CLSMIN550_02082_SEQ_02","You find Wide Gulley speaking with Adalberta. Though you came to speak with the latter, it is the former who tells you where to find the titanium. It seems that some years ago, Deep Canyon came across a similar sample of the metal in the hands of a hunter who made his living in the Dravanian forelands. Wide Gulley swears that the chunk of metal you brought is identical to the one the hunter had, and Adalberta theorizes that the ore must originate in the area. Return now to Haimirich at the Forgotten Knight with this piece of information."
3,"TEXT_CLSMIN550_02082_SEQ_03","Upon hearing it was a hunter who found the first sample of titanium, Haimirich exclaims that the vein of ore you seek must be somewhere near the Chocobo Forest. Though this is hardly definitive, Haimirich is willing to mobilize Oschon's Raiders on this hunch. Rendezvous with them in the Dravanian forelands."
4,"TEXT_CLSMIN550_02082_SEQ_04","Haimirich dispatches his men to mind the perimeter while you search for the presence of a rich lode beneath the trees. Mine ten chunks of high-quality titanium ore from nearby mineral deposits, and deliver them to the captain when you are done."
5,"TEXT_CLSMIN550_02082_SEQ_05","Haimirich happily takes the ore, and, after Muscles returns from clearing the path homewards, bids you all return to Ishgard. Make your way back to the Holy See and speak with Haimirich there."
6,"TEXT_CLSMIN550_02082_SEQ_06","You find Haimirich both happy and worried. The cause is Hatchling. The captain tells you that the lad has a bright future, but only if he can overcome his own pride. Failing that, he may very well find himself in a situation he cannot outlive. Though you feel there is more to this story, Haimirich suddenly changes subjects, and you sense that now is not the time to ask further.

※The next miner quest will be available from Haimirich upon reaching level 58."

50,"TEXT_CLSMIN550_02082_HEIMIRICH_000_002","'Tis a risky gambit, an' they'll need the very best gear to succeed─blades that won't blunt against dragon scale an' armor that'll withstand Dravanian claws. Normal metal jus' won't cut it."
51,"TEXT_CLSMIN550_02082_HEIMIRICH_000_003","Which takes me back to titanium. The smithies tell me it's the only metal that'll serve, an' they need a proper reserve to armor all the knights. So do you happen to know where we might find a goodly vein of ore?"

65,"TEXT_CLSMIN550_02082_WIDEGULLEY_000_048","That said, titanium is rare, an' the hunter may've just found it by chance. But go an' see what you can dig up. If you do find a vein, maybe that'll help settle my debt to you."
