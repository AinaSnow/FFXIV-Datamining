1,"TEXT_CLSARM502_02038_SEQ_01","A perturbed Forgemaster H'naanza welcomes your visit, and immediately requests your aid in an urgent matter. It seems that Blanstyr, your old rival, has decided that donning his own work and charging into battle is the only way to improve his knowledge of armorcraft. Speak with Blanstyr, and convince him of the danger inherent in this reckless plan."
2,"TEXT_CLSARM502_02038_SEQ_02","You attempt to dissuade Blanstyr from his course, but the stubborn armorer is deaf to your pleas. Return to H'naanza, and report your failure."
3,"TEXT_CLSARM502_02038_SEQ_03","Disappointed─but not entirely unsurprised─by your report, the forgemaster next bids you follow the old craftsman into lower La Noscea and protect him from undue harm. Look for Blanstyr in the vicinity of the Eyes."
4,"TEXT_CLSARM502_02038_SEQ_04","You catch up to Blanstyr, only to find that he has been rescued from certain death by a passing party of adventurers. Still in a state of shock, the armorer seems dumbfounded by the weight and discomfort of his protective equipment. Return to the Armorers' Guild and report events to H'naanza."
5,"TEXT_CLSARM502_02038_SEQ_05","The forgemaster is relieved to hear of Blanstyr's rescue, but fears that the single-minded old man is far from done with his foolishness. She bids you aid him with his work in the hopes that the example of your craft will prove more persuasive than mere words. Speak with Blanstyr, and offer him the assistance of your hammer."
6,"TEXT_CLSARM502_02038_SEQ_06","You approach Blanstyr, and the determined armorer describes to you the depths of his revelations. From this point forward, he vows to craft with the needs of his customers forefront in his mind. Aid Blanstyr in his quest for greatness, and use this opportunity to improve your own techniques.

※The next armorer quest will be available from Blanstyr upon reaching level 53."

49,"TEXT_CLSARM502_02038_HNAANZA_000_001","Ever since he lost that contest, he's been keeping his distance from the forge. Then one day he simply appears as if naught had happened, and starts banging out a breastplate on one of the anvils."
