Ansaulme, the rodless rover in question, is an authority on far-flung fishing holes. Hurry to the Drowning Wench to return the rod to Ansaulme before he journeys on."
2,"TEXT_CLSFSH502_02085_SEQ_02","Ansaulme is delighted to be reunited with his most faithful companion, and is fascinated to hear of your achievements in the field of fishing. He is eager to discuss the subject in more depth, but as he cannot linger in Limsa Lominsa as long as he would like, he invites you to his hometown to continue the conversation. Journey to Ishgard and meet with Ansaulme in the Forgotten Knight to learn more of the fishing holes of his homeland."
3,"TEXT_CLSFSH502_02085_SEQ_03","Ansaulme welcomes you to Ishgard and promises to give you a guided tour of his homeland's best fishing holes─weather permitting, of course. Speak with Ansaulme again when the storms have settled in Coerthas, and he will show you the sights.

※The next fisher quest will be available from Ansaulme upon reaching level 53."
