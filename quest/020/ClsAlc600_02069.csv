1,"TEXT_CLSALC600_02069_SEQ_01","It seems your suspect has provided the name of the mastermind: Waoud, an alchemist from the Near East. Chanene has gone to ascertain more about these so-called clones from the Sons of Saint Coinach. Venture to their headquarters at Saint Coinach's Find to find out what she has learned."
2,"TEXT_CLSALC600_02069_SEQ_02","Chanene has learned much about the clones from Rammbroes. They are empty vessels, without souls, and from this Chanene hypothesizes that Waoud means to transfer his own spirit into younger copies of himself, and gain eternal life in the process. She breathlessly tells you that Waoud has established a new base to the southeast of Revenant's Toll. Meet her there to capture this criminal mastermind."
3,"TEXT_CLSALC600_02069_SEQ_03","You capture Waoud without a struggle. Wiltwaek finds this perplexing, and asks you await him at your usual spot in Revenant's Toll so he may question the suspect."
4,"TEXT_CLSALC600_02069_SEQ_04","You find Wiltwaek frustrated. It seems that Waoud is now denying that he is Waoud, and that he is an alchemist. Given that the evidence against him is circumstantial, Wiltwaek bids you take the one thing found on your suspect─a copy of <Emphasis>Noble Gold</Emphasis>─to Guildmaster Severian, and ask him for proof that Waoud is your master criminal."
5,"TEXT_CLSALC600_02069_SEQ_05","Severian gives you two important pieces of information. Firstly, only the very best of alchemists can create a copy of <Emphasis>Noble Gold</Emphasis>. Secondly, each alchemist's aether has a unique color to it, which is transferred to any grimoires created through the enchanted ink inscribed within. While normally invisible to the naked eye, the guildmaster has invented a powder to render it visible─spectrolium. With this, you can prove that Waoud created the copy of <Emphasis>Noble Gold</Emphasis>, and that he is a master alchemist. Return now to Wiltwaek with the good news."
6,"TEXT_CLSALC600_02069_SEQ_06","You hand the spectrolium to a grateful Wiltwaek and explain its purpose. Now, your friend informs you, all that is left to do is to create another high-quality copy of <Emphasis>Noble Gold</Emphasis> to prove that Severian's concoction is sound. Craft one now to use at Waoud's trial.

7,"TEXT_CLSALC600_02069_SEQ_07","You watch as Wiltwaek painstakingly crafts his argument from each and every piece of evidence you obtained. With Chanene's help, he also effectively demonstrates that Waoud is indeed a master alchemist, and therefore the architect of these foul murders. However, even when accused point blank, Waoud is strangely silent. You look across the floor, and see the Near Eastern youth─whose eyes suddenly stare back at you. The clone makes a bolt for the door, and Chanene realizes that Waoud must have already transferred his soul into this once-empty vessel. Though Wiltwaek is slow on the uptake, he nevertheless charges and subdues the new Waoud. Speak with him now to wrap up this case once and for all."
8,"TEXT_CLSALC600_02069_SEQ_08","Wiltwaek and Chanene both thank you for your aid as a consulting alchemist, and hope that you will have happier reason to work together in the future.

50,"TEXT_CLSALC600_02069_WILTWAEK_000_002","Waoud is his name. He is feared in Thavnair, his homeland, for a complete lack of scruples and pursuing experiments no man should."
51,"TEXT_CLSALC600_02069_WILTWAEK_000_003","I've also inquired into these clones. The Sons of Saint Coinach know something of the technology. Chanene has gone to their camp to learn more. Would you join her there?"

54,"TEXT_CLSALC600_02069_RAMMBROES_000_030","Ah, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Chanene has asked about clones, but I can tell her no more than you─that they were copies of people, given life through Allagan technology."
55,"TEXT_CLSALC600_02069_RAMMBROES_000_40","Few men know the word. That a researcher, an <Emphasis>alchemist</Emphasis> no less, would try to recreate this art of Allag is as astounding as it is terrifying. The Sons will be vigilant."

58,"TEXT_CLSALC600_02069_CHANENE_000_080","Well, according to him, clones are empty vessels for the most part─soulless and unthinking. So what if Waoud transferred his own spirit <Emphasis>into</Emphasis> a clone, again and again? Eternal life could be his!"
59,"TEXT_CLSALC600_02069_CHANENE_000_081","That's his motive! It explains everything. He stole the relics to dissect Allag's technology, and he stole the people from their beds to test it!"

73,"TEXT_CLSALC600_02069_WILTWAEK_000_132","I jest, of course! No, to convict him we must prove Waoud is Waoud, and your equal as an alchemist. Could you look into that, with your guildmaster's aid?"
74,"TEXT_CLSALC600_02069_WILTWAEK_000_133","Waoud had this copy of <Emphasis>Noble Gold</Emphasis> on him. Severian will want to examine it, I suspect. I just hope it proves to be the evidence we need."

83,"TEXT_CLSALC600_02069_SEVERIAN_000_166","I call it spectrolium, and I daresay this invention of mine will be sufficient to prove who crafted that copy of <Emphasis>Noble Gold</Emphasis>. Here is an onze. Take it to Wiltwaek."
84,"TEXT_CLSALC600_02069_SEVERIAN_000_170","Spectrolium... Yet another wonder sprung from my genius. I daresay Wiltwaek will agree."
