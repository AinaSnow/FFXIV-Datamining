Consult with H'naanza, and discuss how you might best meet your client's wishes."
3,"TEXT_CLSARM550_02040_SEQ_03","Upon hearing the aesthetic nature of the commission, H'naanza suggests that you seek the advice of experts in the field of fashion. Head to Ul'dah, and consult with Serendipity of the Goldsmiths' Guild, and Redolent Rose of the Weavers' Guild."

H'naanza muses over their ideas for a moment before outlining the design of a piece that fulfills the requirements of your client's request. Forge a high-quality titanium cuirass of maiming, and deliver the finished item to Benathaire at the Drowning Wench."

Swallowing his pride for the sake of his craft, the old armorer vows to visit H'naanza, and beg for the wisdom of her experience. Continue to work at Blanstyr's side as you both seek to improve in your chosen trade.
