1,"TEXT_JOBAST502_02020_SEQ_01","Jannequinard has asked you to remain at the Observatorium to ask Forlemort questions you probably should have asked him when you confronted the chief astrologian about his involvement in the attempted kidnapping of Lady Leveva."
2,"TEXT_JOBAST502_02020_SEQ_02","From the chief astrologian and his personal assistant you learn that a band of tattooed Sharlayans are the true masterminds behind the conspiracy to kidnap Leveva. Take this information back to Jannequinard at the Athenaeum."
3,"TEXT_JOBAST502_02020_SEQ_03","Jannequinard believes that Lady Leveva will find the information you gleaned from the chief astrologian of much worth. Find the lady and Quimperain near the Arc of the Venerable and relay to them what you know."
4,"TEXT_JOBAST502_02020_SEQ_04","Lady Leveva has gone missing once again. Quimperain will search in one direction, you are to search in the other."
5,"TEXT_JOBAST502_02020_SEQ_05","The woman you believed to be Lady Leveva was not her at all, despite seeming somehow familiar... Keep searching!"
6,"TEXT_JOBAST502_02020_SEQ_06","You find Lady Leveva and learn of how she foiled another kidnapping attempt. After telling her of your findings, she lets down her guard a moment to talk about her father, who was also an astrologian, and how he died while trying to spread Sharlayan astrology in Ishgard. Jannequinard and Quimperain soon arrive bearing news of the Vault's acceptance of his petition to hold a symposium on astrology. Return to the Athenaeum to begin preparations."
7,"TEXT_JOBAST502_02020_SEQ_07","Also moved by the day's events, Jannequinard, too, opens up to you─his noble guilt suddenly becoming too much to bear on his own.

※The next astrologian quest will be available from Jannequinard upon reaching level 52."

55,"TEXT_JOBAST502_02020_FORLEMORT_000_010","Seven hells! I rue the day I ever see another Sharlayan. Please. I've done all you asked. What more do you want from me, blood!? Or are you simply here to boast?"
56,"TEXT_JOBAST502_02020_FORLEMORT_000_011","...Or mayhap you wish to know how the Sharlayans came to be involved in my scheme? Hah! I thought as much. If it was so important, why didn't your Lady Leveva ask me earlier? Her head is so far in the stars, she fails to see what unfolds around her on the ground."
57,"TEXT_JOBAST502_02020_FORLEMORT_000_012","The truth is, it was never my scheme in the first place─it was the Sharlayans'. They came to me not long after Professor Mace's ship was diverted to Thanalan. Yes, I said diverted. The pirates in the Strait of Merlthor, the magically manipulated storms off the Rhotano? All were staged to prevent your friends from ever arriving. But when they did, the Sharlayans were forced to change their plans. They required help hiring local hands discreetly─something they could not do as foreigners. I agreed to lend them my aid because I felt we both stood to benefit from the disappearance of Jannequinard and that foul chit."

Why, this past moon, he has been entertaining guests with very distinct markings on their faces. I asked Lord Forlemort whence they hailed, and he only answered, “the north.”"

61,"TEXT_JOBAST502_02020_JANNEQUINARD_000_030","The Sharlayans came to him? That can only mean, then, that mine uncle was only a pawn in a much larger game..."
62,"TEXT_JOBAST502_02020_JANNEQUINARD_000_031","A game that began long before we ever became involved. Think back, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. The bandits in the Black Shroud. And those pirates you described that attacked you in Limsa Lominsa. They all had strange facial markings...as did our false astrologian."
63,"TEXT_JOBAST502_02020_JANNEQUINARD_000_032","It is not much, but perhaps Lady Leveva will be able to make more sense out of it all. Despite the time we have spent together, I have this feeling she has yet to be completely honest with us. Ah, but look at me. A beloved relative tries to have me killed, and the next day I begin doubting everyone. What a sad, sad state of affairs..."
64,"TEXT_JOBAST502_02020_JANNEQUINARD_000_033","Perhaps to clear my head I should call on that fine young viscountess visiting House Haillenarte from her family's stead in the eastern highlands.

When you were speaking with Quimperain, someone approached me from behind and placed a dagger to my back. I had no choice but to be led silently away.

72,"TEXT_JOBAST502_02020_LEVEVA_000_061","So Forlemort wasn't the architect of this scheme to drag me back to Sharlayan after all. I had my suspicions... I was a fool to believe <Emphasis>they</Emphasis> would simply let me leave."

He came here several moons after I was born, intending to remain for only a season. However, he never made the return journey... His dream was left unrealized and his newborn daughter left without a father..."

But, that does not mean I do not have my share of troubles, however trivial they may be. Being anything but first in line to a countship is not all “whores and rainbows.” The count only truly cares about his newly appointed heir─just like the rest of my family.

86,"TEXT_JOBAST502_02020_JANNEQUINARD_000_082","For a long time, I tried to prove that I could be as great as my cousin. It is why I went to Sharlayan. It is why I have tried to do things I had no business even trying. Then, once I realized no one was looking, I simply stopped caring, my actions becoming more and more outlandish...because at the end of the day, that is what everyone expected."
87,"TEXT_JOBAST502_02020_JANNEQUINARD_000_083","But then you two walked through that door and helped me realize that maybe life is more than the coffin that has been fitted for me.
