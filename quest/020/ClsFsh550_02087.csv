1,"TEXT_CLSFSH550_02087_SEQ_01","Ansaulme has received an urgent request from your mutual friend Reyna─she has a problem that only one with superlative angling ability can solve. However, as Ansaulme's own business will keep him in Ishgard for the foreseeable future, he asks you to respond to the summons in his place. Meet with Reyna in Tailfeather, the chocobo hunters' camp in the Dravanian forelands, and see what trouble is afoot."
2,"TEXT_CLSFSH550_02087_SEQ_02","Reyna tells you of the crisis affecting the camp: a school of carnivorous catfish has made its way into the local river system and is fast devouring the fish the colony relies on for its evening meals. Despite their best efforts to catch the invasive wavekin, the chocobo hunters are better archers than anglers, and could benefit from the tuition of a practiced fisher<If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If>. Reyna bids you follow the Whilom River to the north and rendezvous with the Tailfeather hunter leading the extermination effort. He will brief you as to where the elusive shadowhiskers can be found."
3,"TEXT_CLSFSH550_02087_SEQ_03","The Tailfeather hunter informs you that the shadowhiskers have made their lair in the basin of the Hundred Throes. He asks you to catch three high-quality specimens to show the increasingly exasperated hunters how it is done. Once you have caught the creatures, return your haul to Reyna to make proof of your success."
4,"TEXT_CLSFSH550_02087_SEQ_04","Reyna is overjoyed to see what an excellent example you have set the chocobo hunters─now that they are armed with your advice, the shadowhiskers' days are surely numbered. She is eager to reward you in the same manner as before, but despite racking her brains for a suitably fascinating fishing story, she draws a blank. In her desperation, she turns to Sten, a chocobo hunter of notorious taciturnity. To Reyna's great surprise, he recounts a tale of Far Eastern hellfishing the likes of which she has never heard. Keen to try the sport for herself, she asks you to return to Ansaulme to see if he has any knowledge of the magma worms Sten mentioned in his story."
5,"TEXT_CLSFSH550_02087_SEQ_05","Ansaulme has not only heard of the worms in question, but he has a few of the creatures in his possession. He gives them to you as a reward for responding to Reyna's request on his behalf. Should you wish to try your hand at hellfishing, Ansaulme advises you to travel to the far reaches of the Dravanian forelands, to the fiery lands where the dragons dwell.

※The next fisher quest will be available from Ansaulme upon reaching level 58."

49,"TEXT_CLSFSH550_02087_ANSAULME_000_001","You remember that girl, Reyna─the one who you beat in the fishing contest? Well, she's sent me a message, saying she needs an experienced angler to come and fish her out of a spot of hot water."
50,"TEXT_CLSFSH550_02087_ANSAULME_000_002","She's been trying her hand at a little chocobo hunting over in Dravania─she didn't go into the details, but it seems some problem's cropped up that only a master fisherman can solve."

53,"TEXT_CLSFSH550_02087_ANSAULME_000_005","If that fishing contest proved anything, it's that you know how to handle a rod just as well as I do. I'm sure you'll make a more than adequate stand-in.

57,"TEXT_CLSFSH550_02087_REYNA_000_011","For the past few years, I've been coming here to Tailfeather for the start of the hunting season. It's dangerous work, but it has its rewards. Why, just a couple of weeks chocobo hunting can keep a girl in balloon bugs for the rest of the year!"
58,"TEXT_CLSFSH550_02087_REYNA_000_012","And after a long day's hard work, there's nothing I like better than to head to the riverbank and catch a few carp for the hunters' supper. The problem is, someone's let a school of carnivorous catfish loose in the river, and they're running riot."
59,"TEXT_CLSFSH550_02087_REYNA_000_013","At this rate, they'll have gobbled up every fish in the river before the season's out! I've convinced the hunters to try to catch these monsters before it's too late, but they've had no luck so far. It's no surprise, really─half of them don't even know which bit of the tackle to throw in the water."
60,"TEXT_CLSFSH550_02087_REYNA_000_014","That's where you come in─I need you to help me catch a few of these whiskery invaders and show those hunters how it's done. What do you say, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>?"
61,"TEXT_CLSFSH550_02087_REYNA_000_015","If my master plan works, it's not only the future of our fish suppers that'll be saved for posterity, but the chocobo hunt itself! After all, you can't catch chocobos on an empty stomach! Isn't that right, Stenny boy?"

I had better stay here and keep an eye on him─we wouldn't want him doddering off into the Whilom and giving those nasty catfish something meatier to wrap their teeth around. Do you think you could put my plan into practice yourself?"
64,"TEXT_CLSFSH550_02087_REYNA_000_018","The hunters I sent to catch the catfish should still be upstream somewhere.

Among this merchant's stock was a bucket o' wrigglin' red worms that seemed aglow with heat. Naturally, the boy asked him what they were all about."
