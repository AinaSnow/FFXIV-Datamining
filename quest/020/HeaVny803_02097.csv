1,"TEXT_HEAVNY803_02097_SEQ_01","Lydirlona thinks you would benefit from learning about aetherial reduction. Though she lacks the knowledge to explain in detail, she knows who can: Kokosamu, one of Master Mutamix's many disciples. Seek him out at the Bonfire in central Thanalan to receive your education."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNY803_02097_SEQ_02","Aetherial reduction turns out to be a rather simple process in which one breaks down items into their base aetherial components, such as crystals or other rare materials. However, it would seem that only rare items considered collectables are suitable for this purpose, so whether or not it will prove useful remains to be seen..."
