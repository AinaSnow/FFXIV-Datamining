50,"TEXT_CLSGLD530_02071_MARCEL_000_002","As for what physical form the music box is to take, that is for the artisan to decide. I suggest you begin by speaking with our client yourself. Worry not─I have already made the necessary arrangements. She awaits you at the Sapphire Avenue Exchange."
51,"TEXT_CLSGLD530_02071_MARCEL_000_010","Jeweled Peak awaits you at the Sapphire Avenue Exchange. Now go, and be quick about it─let it not be said that Eshtaime's keeps their clients waiting."

54,"TEXT_CLSGLD530_02071_JEWELEDPEAK_000_032","It will be inlaid with a great gemstone of perfect cut and clarity, yes? Oh, but of course it will! Marcel knows I would settle for nothing less. But what sort of gemstone would suffice? I have always liked rubies...ah, but sapphires are so beautiful as well!"
55,"TEXT_CLSGLD530_02071_JEWELEDPEAK_000_033","Perhaps both, if that wouldn't be too ostentatious? Heavens, I'm starting to confuse myself... Oh, but look at the time! I'm afraid I must be off. Do give my regards to Marcel."

Why, that is so exceptionally inspired it's a wonder that I wasn't the one who thought of it!"
57,"TEXT_CLSGLD530_02071_MARCEL_000_051","As the music box itself will be quite large, we will require stones of impressive size to match. It will be no small task to see that all elements─gold and gemstone alike─are balanced, complementing each other and achieving perfect harmony."
