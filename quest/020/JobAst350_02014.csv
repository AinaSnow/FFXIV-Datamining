The stars tell me you have been rigorously following Leveva's training regimen...though I harbor doubts that “go out and do things while I traipse about the realm” constitutes a regimen."
49,"TEXT_JOBAST350_02014_JANNEQUINARD_000_001","Still, she is all we have, so I suppose we have to make do. And, as the stars would have it, she has just sent word that she is ready for us to attempt the opening of the second heaven's gate."
50,"TEXT_JOBAST350_02014_JANNEQUINARD_000_002","You are aware of the seven heavens, are you not? Just as there are seven realms of the underworld, so too are there seven realms of the firmament. Each of the first six represent one of the six basic elements─earth, ice, water, wind, lightning, and fire─the seventh and final heaven representing the elements' astral polarity."
51,"TEXT_JOBAST350_02014_JANNEQUINARD_000_003","The first six heavens are represented by the six constellations which each revolve around the pole star."
52,"TEXT_JOBAST350_02014_JANNEQUINARD_000_004","Astrologians of the Sharlayan school draw on the aether contained in the celestial bodies represented in the constellations by “unlocking” or “opening” the gate to heaven that constellation is correlated with. There is no <Emphasis>actual</Emphasis> gate...think of it as more a portal to the soul. You are opening your mind, allowing for attunement with these distant bodies, much like one attunes with an aetheryte, but on a far grander scale."
53,"TEXT_JOBAST350_02014_JANNEQUINARD_000_005","Now this may come as a revelation, but Hydaelyn is not flat like most believe. It is, in fact, a sphere so large, that when we walk upon it, it only <Emphasis>appears</Emphasis> to be flat. Because it is a sphere, there are some locations better suited than others for observing certain constellations. That is what Leveva is doing right now─finding a location in which the next heaven's gate will rise to a position directly in midheaven, where it will be easiest to attune with. And it seems she has found one...near the Final Prayer in eastern Thanalan."
54,"TEXT_JOBAST350_02014_JANNEQUINARD_000_009","Oh, I harbor no ill feelings toward you regarding Professor Mace's decision to choose you over me as his successor. To tell you the truth, I was even sort of relieved. The successor to the greatest astrologian in Sharlayan? Think of all the responsibility..."
55,"TEXT_JOBAST350_02014_JANNEQUINARD_000_010","I don't believe my travels have ever taken me this far south. A tad dusty for my tastes. And warm. And dry. And brown."

57,"TEXT_JOBAST350_02014_LEVEVA_000_011","Here at last, I see. Bandits have kept poor Quimperain busy, harrying our camp since we arrived. I do believe the old man enjoys the excitement, however.

80,"TEXT_JOBAST350_02014_JANNEQUINARD_000_044","That is exactly what I have been trying to tell the astrologians of my home nation. Why disregard something that has the power to grant succor to the wounded, the power to uplift the downtrodden, to strengthen the weak?"
81,"TEXT_JOBAST350_02014_LEVEVA_000_045","The answer to that is easy. Empowering those without power lessens the power of those who already have it. Heal the weak so they might rise up and topple those who made them weak? Why would anyone in a position of power do that? Even our great nation of learning is corrupted by this manner of thought. We hoard our knowledge so that we might remain the brightest."

Yes, I know what he <Emphasis>told</Emphasis> you, but that was not the whole of it. Those of the Ruling Quarter did their damndest to stand in the way of my grandfather, worried that his passion for his field would kindle widespread interest in Sharlayan astrology. They only allowed him his recent trip, knowing he was now too old to do aught of the sort. Fortunately, the Ruling Quarter did not realize I would be accompanying my grandfather."

Yet while you have opened half the heavens' gates, there is still much of what we like to refer to as the “royal road” ahead of you. Take what you have learned here in the southern deserts and transform that knowledge into strength. If you wish to know more of the royal road, I suggest that you discuss it with Jannequinard back in Ishgard. If my grandfather is to be believed, his time transcribing tomes back at the Studium scriptorium should have left him more than capable of handling that task."
