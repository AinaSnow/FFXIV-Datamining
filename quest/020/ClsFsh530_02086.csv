1,"TEXT_CLSFSH530_02086_SEQ_01","News has reached Ansaulme that a school of icepicks, fish as defiant as they are delicious, has been sighted in a secluded fishing hole in the Coerthas western highlands. Eager to show you the sights of his homeland, as well as pit his wits against such a fractious fish, he bids you meet with him by the north entrance of Falcon's Nest, whence he will guide you to the fishing hole in question."
2,"TEXT_CLSFSH530_02086_SEQ_02","You make the appointed rendezvous with Ansaulme, only to learn that he has already been to the fishing hole and back. While awaiting your arrival, a fellow fisher named Reyna engaged him in a fish-off─a competition that he duly lost, catching only a single high-quality icepick to Reyna's two. Eager to silence the fisherwoman's taunts, he asks you to catch three high-quality icepicks to steal Reyna's thunder. The fish can be found in an unfrozen pond in the Gorgagne Holding, to the north of Falcon's Nest."
3,"TEXT_CLSFSH530_02086_SEQ_03","You dutifully deliver the trio of icepicks to Ansaulme, beating Reyna's record and confirming your place at the top table of the fishing fraternity. As a reward for your efforts, Reyna tells you a tale of a chocobo hunter who angled from a floating island, opening your eyes to a new way of fishing. The bait Ansaulme gave you as his own reward may serve you well should you wish to try your hand at cloudfishing, and pluck fish from the skies themselves.

※The next fisher quest will be available from Ansaulme upon reaching level 55."

72,"TEXT_CLSFSH530_02086_REYNA_000_052","Not so very long ago, there was a chocobo hunter who found a wounded fish on the shore of the Sea of Clouds. It was a moogle spirit─known to fishermen the realm over as the manta of the skies. A hook was through its lip, an unattended rod lying at its side."
73,"TEXT_CLSFSH530_02086_REYNA_000_053","The hunter took up the rod and freed the fish, but as soon as he did so, the spirit scooped him in its fins and swept him away to an island above the clouds!

74,"TEXT_CLSFSH530_02086_REYNA_000_054","Within moments there was jerk on the line, and he pulled up a strange fish covered in spines. A few more minutes of fishing, and he had enough of the things to spell out “help” in cloudkin. His message was spotted by a passing airship, and the fellow was saved!
...Well, what do you think? The chocobo hunters tell it to their children as a bedtime story, but I've got a funny feeling there might be more to it than that."
75,"TEXT_CLSFSH530_02086_REYNA_100_054","But anyway, I can't stand around chatting while there's work to be done. If that story tickled you, why don't you go and have a look around the Sea of Clouds? If you're lucky, you might catch a few of these helpful fish yourselves!"
76,"TEXT_CLSFSH530_02086_ANSAULME_000_056","Hmmm...these strange fish the chocobo hunter pulled from the clouds─I think I might have an idea what they were. The Ishgardian nobility used to harvest them for their poison─so much so that they drove them to extinction. Or so I thought, until now..."
77,"TEXT_CLSFSH530_02086_ANSAULME_000_057","Here, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, take some of these. The noblemen used to bait their hooks with these red balloons to catch those fish─if the creatures really are still around, chances are their tastes haven't changed."
78,"TEXT_CLSFSH530_02086_ANSAULME_000_058","Balloon bugs spend their lives in the skies but they make their nests in the earth. If you should need any more of them, a friendly botanist or miner should be able to dig some out for you."
79,"TEXT_CLSFSH530_02086_ANSAULME_000_059","But anyway, thanks for today─you really saved my skin. If Reyna had won that contest, I don't think I ever would have lived it down.
