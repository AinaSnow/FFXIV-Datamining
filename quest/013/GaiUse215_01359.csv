According to the scout you rescued, the summoning ritual is being held at the beastman aetheryte situated deep within the Sapsa Spawning Grounds. Accompany Y'shtola into the Sahagin lair, and fight your way to the aetheryte."

But no sooner did the primal manifest than he bent his course for the open sea. Her voice laden with dread, Merlwyb expresses her fear that Leviathan means to unleash a tidal wave. Speak with her again, that you might better understand the impending danger."

If the primal is not stopped, whole settlements will be laid waste. But with the Lord of the Whorl already far out to sea, how can such a disaster be prevented?"
