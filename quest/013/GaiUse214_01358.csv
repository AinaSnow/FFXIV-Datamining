She bids you ascertain their fate, and furnishes you with a flask of restorative on the chance that her men are injured. Start your search by focusing on the entrance to the Sapsa Spawning Grounds, and treat any wounded you find."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSE214_01358_SEQ_02","You have located one of the scouts and given him the restorative.

Though the price was dear, the Maelstrom now has the intelligence it sought, and the operation may commence. See to your preparations, and be ready to move out at a moment's notice."
