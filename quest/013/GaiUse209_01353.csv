After briefly speculating upon their fate, she changes the subject and asks about the Domans─to which you reply that Yugiri will arrive at any moment. In the subsequent meeting, Minfilia assures Yugiri that she will do her utmost to accommodate her people, as well as any others who may follow. With formal introductions now complete, all present part ways to make ready for the imminent arrival of the first carriages."
