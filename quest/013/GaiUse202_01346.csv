1,"TEXT_GAIUSE202_01346_SEQ_01","For want of a better idea, Thancred suggests consulting Fufulupa once more. Speak with the Brass Blade and find out if he has aught to offer."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSE202_01346_SEQ_02","Upon learning that someone within the Brass Blades' ranks may be involved in the crystal thefts, Thancred and Y'shtola devise a plan to lure the thieves into the open. Posing as a courier in possession of crystals, Y'shtola will act as bait, while you and Thancred observe from a distance. Should the thieves appear, you are to subdue them by any means necessary."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSE202_01346_SEQ_03","Y'shtola's ruse succeeds in drawing the thieves out into the open, but when the trap is sprung, it quickly becomes clear that they will not be taken alive. Left with no other choice, you fight till each lies dead. Report all that has occurred to Y'shtola."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSE202_01346_SEQ_04","Although the thieves had naught in their possession to indicate their allegiance, Thancred notes that all were Sea Wolves, and that each of them sported distinctive blue facial tattoos. This observation appears to prompt a revelation in Y'shtola, who immediately takes her leave to make inquiries. Having been placed in charge of matters in Thanalan, Thancred invites you to return with him to Horizon and report to Fufulupa."
5,"TEXT_GAIUSE202_01346_SEQ_05","Fufulupa informs you that the traitorous Brass Blade was identified while you were away, but that the Lominsan-born Sea Wolf subdued the unit sent to detain him and took flight. Though he assures you that his comrades will soon hunt down the fugitive, you wonder if the task might better be entrusted to one more capable. Before you can volunteer, however, Thancred is informed via linkpearl that your services are needed elsewhere."

55,"TEXT_GAIUSE202_01346_FUFULUPA_000_012","I was contemplating as to how the thieves' activities escaped our notice for so long, and then it came to me! What if there is someone among our own ranks conspiring with them─a traitor in our own midst!?"
56,"TEXT_GAIUSE202_01346_THANCRED_000_013","...It would be most unfortunate if your fears proved well founded, Fufulupa."
57,"TEXT_GAIUSE202_01346_YSHTOLA_000_014","Indeed. If, for reasons of security, the Concern decided to transfer the remaining crystals stored in Horizon to another location, their plans would be discovered the moment the Brass Blades were informed."
58,"TEXT_GAIUSE202_01346_THANCRED_000_015","Ah, but such a shipment would surely be well guarded. Would thieves as wily as ours risk open confrontation?"

81,"TEXT_GAIUSE202_01346_FUFULUPA_000_043","Ah...no. I am afraid that will not be possible. Regrettably, he, um...managed to subdue the unit of Blades dispatched to detain him, and made good his escape."
