1,"TEXT_BANSAH004_01377_SEQ_01","In an unmistakable sign of his growing trust in you, Novv has asked that you watch over his spawnlings while he attends to a task outside of the nursery. While he has faith that Seww, Houu, and Fyuu can shoulder the duties of feeding and disciplining their clutchmates, the clutchfather is concerned that the Coral Tridents may attempt some manner of retaliation in his absence. Seww, however, seems distressed at Novv's departure. Speak with the young Sahagin, and learn what troubles him."
2,"TEXT_BANSAH004_01377_SEQ_02","Seww confides in you that the clutchfather has always been reticent about his past, and the spawnling wonders if this mysterious task has any connection to Novv's unspoken history. He asks that you track down the elder Sahagin who once fought with Novv, and learn what secrets they might unwittingly reveal. Take the clutchmark given to you by Seww, and visit the veteran beastmen found near the Reef of Sending, in Reaver Hide, and on Moonshade Isle."
3,"TEXT_BANSAH004_01377_SEQ_03","Though initially reluctant to speak with you, the curiosity of the elder Sahagin warriors is piqued once you show them the clutchmark you carry. Among other information of note, you learn that the reason for Novv's absence is to attend a parley with Zugg, the leader of the Coral Tridents. Return to Novv's Nursery and report your findings to Seww."
4,"TEXT_BANSAH004_01377_SEQ_04","Upon hearing of the impending meeting, Seww seems convinced that his clutchfather is walking into an ambush. The young Sahagin insists that he and his spawnbrothers can defend the nursery, and begs that you make haste to the site of the parley. Make your way to the Serpent's Tongue in western La Noscea, and witness the meeting unfold."
5,"TEXT_BANSAH004_01377_SEQ_05","Before the parley is revealed for the ambush it always was, you learn the secret of Novv's hidden past: the clutchfather was once the Scarlet Sea Devil, the savage Sahagin pirate that terrorized the seas off western La Noscea. His intimidating aura undiminished, Novv breaks the spirit of his would-be attackers without a single word and dismisses Zugg with barely concealed contempt. Follow Novv's advice, and rendezvous with the clutchfather back at Novv's Nursery."
6,"TEXT_BANSAH004_01377_SEQ_06","Summoning his son Seww to his side, Novv proceeds to regale you with the tale of his violent past. He describes the terrible deeds he committed, and tells of the bloody vengeance visited upon his ill-fated offspring. The sorrowful story, however, concludes on a hopeful note: with your help, the clutchfather means to break the cycle of rage and retaliation, and build the foundation for a lasting peace between your peoples."
