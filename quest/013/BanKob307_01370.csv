In the latest effort to that end, he has employed diggers fashioned for him under duress by the accomplished metalworkers of the 86th Order.

5,"TEXT_BANKOB307_01370_SEQ_05","Bo Bu is overjoyed to hear of your success, relishing the knowledge that the 789th will be competing on even terms with Zo Ga's favored ones, at least for the day.
