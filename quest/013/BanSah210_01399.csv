1,"TEXT_BANSAH210_01399_SEQ_01","The Coral Tridents have seized a merchant vessel, bent on mastering the dubious art of sending shorewalker ships to their watery doom. Your task is to board the merchantman and dispatch four surfspine Sahagin. The open water being a cruel mistress to tender-skinned shorewalkers such as yourself, ask Pahh the seabeast tamer to provide you with an elbst for the journey. "
2,"TEXT_BANSAH210_01399_SEQ_02","The surfspine saboteurs are dead, their careers in maritime demolition over ere they began. You are unmoved, having chosen your own job far more wisely than these Sahagin did. An adventurer goes everywhere, meets everyone, does anything─then returns to clients to report the job's success."
3,"TEXT_BANSAH210_01399_SEQ_03","Houu minces no words in denouncing the dead surfspine Sahagin as blackguards, and wonders why anyone would devote their strengths to death and blight. Listening to Houu, you are uneasily reminded that the first casualties of any revolution are the mild of heart."
