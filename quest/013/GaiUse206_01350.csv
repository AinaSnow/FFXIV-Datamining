2,"TEXT_GAIUSE206_01350_SEQ_02","Hozan is proud of his son, and with good reason: Yozan has already instructed the other children to make their preparations. The only ones who have yet to be located are a trio who were engaged in a game of hide-and-seek. It would seem that the children are very serious when it comes to the game, and will not move from their hiding spots unless found, leaving you with no choice but to find them yourself."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSE206_01350_SEQ_03","Despite their dedication to the game, the three remaining children were not particularly good at it. Inform Hozan that your work is finished."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSE206_01350_SEQ_04","You learn that Yugiri is responsible for the children's regular practice of hide-and-seek, as she deemed it necessary to ensure their survival in the event of an imperial attack. Many would consider it a valuable skill, to be sure─albeit one Hozan hopes the children never need to use."
