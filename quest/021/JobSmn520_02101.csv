1,"TEXT_JOBSMN520_02101_SEQ_01","Y'mhitra confesses that her studies have yet to reveal the reason behind the failure of the Austerities of Lightning, but is otherwise pleased to announce the discovery of several new summoner incantations. Her attempt to instruct you, however, is suddenly interrupted by the arrival of Captain Dancing Wolf─an Immortal Flames officer who claims to be in pursuit of the dark summoner, Tristan. Though Tristan was apparently consumed by fire at the culmination of your battle, Captain Wolf has witness accounts that place him at the scene of a merchant caravan attack. Unwilling to dismiss the possibility that the dangerous madman yet lives, Y'mhitra requests that you both be allowed to assist in the ongoing investigation. Travel to Camp Drybone in eastern Thanalan, and speak with Dancing Wolf."
2,"TEXT_JOBSMN520_02101_SEQ_02","You join Captain Wolf in Camp Drybone, and the officer sets you the task of searching for more witnesses to the incident. Make your way around the settlement, and gather more information from the merchants."
3,"TEXT_JOBSMN520_02101_SEQ_03","You speak with several Camp Drybone inhabitants, and learn that a survivor of the attack has recently left town. Return to Dancing Wolf, and report your findings."
4,"TEXT_JOBSMN520_02101_SEQ_04","Upon learning that the merchant who survived the attack has but recently left Camp Drybone, Captain Wolf immediately sets off in pursuit. Search the road heading east towards Highbridge, and find the assaulted importer."
5,"TEXT_JOBSMN520_02101_SEQ_05","You come across the unfortunate trader under attack by an Amalj'aa raiding party. After saving him from the beastmen's spears, the merchant gratefully provides you with a description of the man responsible for the caravan attack. The silvery-haired villain appears to have been in command of Ifrit-Egi, further deepening your suspicions that Tristan is indeed still alive. Head to Ul'dah, and discuss these developments with Dancing Wolf at the Hall of Flames."
6,"TEXT_JOBSMN520_02101_SEQ_06","You meet Captain Wolf at the Immortal Flames headquarters, and once more hear the tragic story of how Tristan was compelled to slay his own brother. As the dark summoner was once a soldier under his command, Dancing Wolf feels bound by duty to expunge the evil Tristan has become. Accept Y'mhitra's instruction in the damaging magicks recovered from the tomestones, and prepare for the day when you may once more face the madman's flames.

※The next summoner quest will be available from Dancing Wolf upon reaching level 54."

Since we last met, the arduous task of deciphering those tomestones has occupied my every waking moment. I have made significant progress, but the cause of the ritual's failure yet eludes me..."
49,"TEXT_JOBSMN520_02101_YMHITRA_000_001","I am somewhat heartened, however, by my discovery of a number of new incantations. In fact, there is one spell which I believe you could soon master with a minimum of instruct─
...Hm?"
50,"TEXT_JOBSMN520_02101_DANCINGWOLF_000_002","Pray forgive my interruption. You are the leaders of the research effort on summoning magicks, yes?"
51,"TEXT_JOBSMN520_02101_DANCINGWOLF_000_003","I am Captain Dancing Wolf, of the Immortal Flames. It is fortunate that I find you together, as I have questions for you both..."
52,"TEXT_JOBSMN520_02101_YMHITRA_000_004","And what would the Immortal Flames want with us, Captain Wolf? Does Ul'dah's military have some vested interest in the activities of summoners?"
53,"TEXT_JOBSMN520_02101_DANCINGWOLF_000_005","Just one summoner in particular, madam. We seek a man by the name of Tristan."
54,"TEXT_JOBSMN520_02101_DANCINGWOLF_000_006","...Then you <Emphasis>do</Emphasis> know him. I've read reports that you had been in pursuit of our former soldier, but I always like to have confirmation on our intelligence."
55,"TEXT_JOBSMN520_02101_DANCINGWOLF_000_007","The Immortal Flames has its own reasons for wanting Tristan found. If you have any idea of his whereabouts, then I must know what you know!"
56,"TEXT_JOBSMN520_02101_DANCINGWOLF_000_008","So, Tristan matched his summoning magicks against yours, and was ultimately consumed in fire. ...And you are certain he perished?"

58,"TEXT_JOBSMN520_02101_DANCINGWOLF_000_010","I do not doubt the veracity of your tale, but...there has been an incident. A merchant caravan was recently attacked by a man who, by the description given, closely resembles Tristan in appearance."

62,"TEXT_JOBSMN520_02101_DANCINGWOLF_000_014","Your combined expertise in the summoning arts is most welcome, Lady Y'mhitra. The attack occurred on one of the roads out of Camp Drybone─join me at the settlement proper, and we can continue the search for witnesses."

79,"TEXT_JOBSMN520_02101_MERCHANT02101_000_064","By his stature, I marked him of Hyuran stock...and by his fiery servant, a hells-spawned demon in disguise."

89,"TEXT_JOBSMN520_02101_DANCINGWOLF_000_086","Our unit was one of many deployed in the mission to destroy the primal Ifrit─an operation that succeeded at a staggering cost. Those who were not incinerated were tempered...with Kahedin suffering the latter fate."
90,"TEXT_JOBSMN520_02101_DANCINGWOLF_000_087","As you well know, a primal's power is fueled by the faith of its thralls─and the greatest mercy we can grant such unfortunates is a swift journey to Thal's hallowed halls. Tristan <Emphasis>volunteered</Emphasis> to end the cursed existence of his own brother."
91,"TEXT_JOBSMN520_02101_DANCINGWOLF_000_088","He returned to Ul'dah with Kahedin's blood on his blade, and I watched, helpless, as the guilt slowly strangled the life in his eyes. No words of comfort could reach him, and when he at last quit the Flames, he was a husk of the man he once was.
Never did I imagine his grief-maddened mind would drive him to such desperate evils."

94,"TEXT_JOBSMN520_02101_YMHITRA_000_091","To that end, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, I would teach you one of the incantations I gleaned from those repositories of Allagan wisdom. 'Tis a spell of damaging magick, employed in combat by the summoners of eld."
95,"TEXT_JOBSMN520_02101_YMHITRA_000_092","Let us call upon Captain Wolf again once you have mastered its use. It would not do to engage Tristan while stumbling over unfamiliar magicks."
