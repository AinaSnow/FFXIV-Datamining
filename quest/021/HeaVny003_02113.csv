1,"TEXT_HEAVNY003_02113_SEQ_01","Notrelchamps informs you that your erstwhile companion Wedge is looking for you to assist in some top secret project of the utmost urgency. Seek the small fellow out at the Aetherochemical Research Facility in Azys Lla and see what could possibly be so important."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNY003_02113_SEQ_02","You meet Wedge at the Aetherochemical Research Facility, where he reveals the nature of his project. The ever-emotional youth seeks to restore life to “Gilly,” the helpful guidance node who showed you about in your travels through Azys Lla. To that end, he entreats you to travel to the Fractal Continuum─a museum of Allagan technology housed inside a decommissioned warship─and come back with a new node nacelle, into which Gilly's “heart” might be transferred. Venture to Matter Conduit VI–VII and access the teleporter there."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNY003_02113_SEQ_03","You successfully locate the teleporter that will grant you access to the Fractal Continuum, which issues you a warning regarding security clearance and anti-intruder systems that bodes ill for your impending visit. Ignore it and brave whatever awaits within, that Gilly might live on.

※The Fractal Continuum can be accessed via the Duty Finder."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNY003_02113_SEQ_04","You have triumphed over the chimerical horrors that inhabited the Fractal Continuum to emerge with a top-of-the-line nacelle that will serve as a new body for Wedge's favorite guidance node. Take pride in the fact that you've done right by Gilly, and deliver the nacelle to the Lalafellin engineer back at the Aetherochemical Research Facility."
5,"TEXT_HEAVNY003_02113_SEQ_05","Gilly's new body works like a charm, and Wedge rejoices at being reunited with his friend. He then entrusts the guidance node to you, that she might accompany you on your adventures and see that there is more to the world than the aetheric wastes she has known for the past five thousand years. Go forth with your loyal new accompaniment node at your side!"
