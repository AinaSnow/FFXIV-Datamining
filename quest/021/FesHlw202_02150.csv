※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESHLW202_02150_SEQ_01","After bidding you join him as soon as possible, the Adventurers' Guild investigator leaves directly for Hyrstmill. Make your own way to the settlement in the North Shroud, and help the adventurer put a stop to the Continental Circus's mayhem.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESHLW202_02150_SEQ_02","You join the investigator in Hyrstmill, and he reports that his worst fears have been confirmed: it appears that several children have already vanished. The worried matron nearby explains that the younglings ran out of her sight for only a moment, but have since failed to return. Heed the investigator's advice, and question Hyrstmill inhabitants for any leads as to the children's whereabouts."
3,"TEXT_FESHLW202_02150_SEQ_03","You speak with a number of Hyrstmill residents and learn that a stranger in a witch's costume was seen leading the younglings into the shadow of a building. Return to the Adventurers' Guild investigator and report your findings."
4,"TEXT_FESHLW202_02150_SEQ_04","You return to the investigator, and he laments his inability to learn anything of the children's fate. After you relay the story told to you by the villager, however, he soon returns his attention to the task at hand, asking that you follow up on the lead while he reports this development to the Adventurers' Guild. Head over to the spot described by the witness, and spy on the suspicious witch."
5,"TEXT_FESHLW202_02150_SEQ_05","No sooner have you concealed yourself at a convenient vantage point, when the suspicious witch appears with an enthusiastic child in tow. With promises of a wonderful costume to celebrate All Saints' Wake, the villain then transforms the youngling into a horrible fiend. The newly transformed youngling flaps happily away, to the delight of the witch's next visitor─the Impresario. Through their clandestine conversation, you discover the Continental Circus's diabolical plan to harvest the fear the children will undoubtedly feel once they learn the truth: their hideous transformations are permanent. With the power siphoned from innocent terror, the Circus means to summon a demonic legion, and visit upon the realm a second Night of Devilry.

As you withdraw from the shadowed meeting place, you are confronted by a pumpkin-headed apparition. Instead of offering you harm, however, she sympathizes with the children's plight, and provides you with the means to dispel the witch's terrible enchantment. Return to the Adventurers' Guild investigator, and report all that has occurred."
6,"TEXT_FESHLW202_02150_SEQ_06","The investigator listens to your tale with growing horror, and vows to stop the Continental Circus from plunging the realm into darkness. The adventurer then bids you follow the instructions of the pumpkin-headed stranger, and don attire suitable for celebrating All Saints' Wake. Equip a witch's hat, a witch's coatee, a pair of witch's gloves, and a pair of witch's thighboots before speaking with the Adventurers' Guild investigator once more."
7,"TEXT_FESHLW202_02150_SEQ_07","The investigator pronounces your garb appropriately festive, and sends you off to rescue the unsuspecting children from their ghastly curse. Find the transformed children, and give them each a creepy cookie."
8,"TEXT_FESHLW202_02150_SEQ_08","You give each of the metamorphosed younglings a counter-curse treat, and they are instantly freed from the witch's enchantment. Return to the Adventurers' Guild investigator and report your success."
