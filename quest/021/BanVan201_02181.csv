Fondly recalling the richness of the soil around her former village, she asks you to return to retrieve some sackfuls to be used on Ok' Gundu Nakki, as well as some fire-touched wind crystals to treat the existing soil.

50,"TEXT_BANVAN201_02181_RANUVALI_000_010","Ranu Vali is glad netherling came. There is lots to do and scarce to work with for preparing village land for tilling. As of this sun, earth of Ok' Gundu Nakki is dry as dhalmel bones, impossible to grow crops."
51,"TEXT_BANVAN201_02181_RANUVALI_000_011","See here? How it blows away like dust in breeze? Ranu tries sowing and sowing, but soil is not favorable for almonds, or lemons, or even sanuwa relief patch!"
52,"TEXT_BANVAN201_02181_RANUVALI_000_012","Even so, Ranu still has hope, remembers soil of old village. Very rich for tilling, very reason why ancestors settle on that spot.
