※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESSUM204_02139_SEQ_01","J'nangho tells you of how the Yellow Ranger has perfected a new and deadly attack and he swears its potency is such that it can easily take down any Bombards that have the misfortune to be on the receiving end. The problem? He has yet to test it out on actual Bombards. Requesting that you first weaken the voidsent beasts and then capture them using flame-resistant nets, J'nangho would then like you to release them in the general vicinity of the proud Ranger, so that both you and he can gauge just how effective his attack truly is.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESSUM204_02139_SEQ_02","After a bit of hacking and slashing, you manage to weaken and then capture three Bygone Bombards with heat-resistant nets. With them in hand, travel to the area where the Yellow Ranger is training and release the voidsent beasts at the designated location."
3,"TEXT_FESSUM204_02139_SEQ_03","Soon after you release the Bygone Bombards, the Yellow Ranger catches sight of the creatures and urges you to fall back as he unleashes his attack. He quickly takes care of them, emerging from the battle mostly unscathed. Return to Haermaga with an update on how training is progressing."
4,"TEXT_FESSUM204_02139_SEQ_04","Haermaga is pleased to hear that the Yellow Ranger's training is progressing as desired, and that there have been no major complications along the way. He thanks you for your help and asks that you continue to lend your support."

49,"TEXT_FESSUM204_02139_JNANGHO_000_001","Indeed, this is exciting news, but he has yet to test this “death-blow” on actual Bombards. Despite his claims, I somehow doubt that swinging his axe at the air and yelling has done much to help him refine his technique."
50,"TEXT_FESSUM204_02139_JNANGHO_000_002","To allow him to gauge just how effective this would be on a real target and assess what might need improvement, I ask that you weaken three Bygone Bombards, capture them with these flame-resistant nets, and then place them in his general vicinity."

I suppose this is a testament to your skill, for I purposely chose this secluded spot that I might practice away from prying eyes. Should the secrets of my Triple Majestic Slash Attack fall into the wrong hands, it could have disastrous and far-reaching consequences!"

70,"TEXT_FESSUM204_02139_BEAUDEFOIN_000_033","Accident or not, however, there is no room for error on the battlefield and I must focus on improving my concentration. The Red Ranger relies heavily on his right-hand man, and I cannot fail him."
