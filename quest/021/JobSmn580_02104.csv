1,"TEXT_JOBSMN580_02104_SEQ_01","Dancing Wolf reports that since your victory over the unfortunate Kahedin, the number of attacks along Thanalan's trade routes has considerably diminished. Such a lack of activity, however, has the officer at a loss as to how to track down your Ascian foe. He urges you to instead speak with Y'mhitra, who apparently has other findings to share. Visit the researcher in Gridania, and learn what new secrets her studies have uncovered."
2,"TEXT_JOBSMN580_02104_SEQ_02","Y'mhitra greets you with great enthusiasm, claiming to have unlocked a good many mysteries during her latest bout of study. She goes on to explain how you might circumvent the intrinsic aetheric limitations that prevented you from summoning Ramuh-Egi by adopting a method used by the ancient Allagans─a technique known as a “trance.” After suggesting that you attempt to infuse yourself with the essence of the terrible Bahamut, she admits that you will need Captain Wolf's assistance to enter what may be the only appropriate ritual location. Make your way to Ul'dah, and speak with Dancing Wolf at the Hall of Flames."
3,"TEXT_JOBSMN580_02104_SEQ_03","Against his better judgment, Dancing Wolf has agreed to help you enter the contested territory of the Carteneau Flats. Head to the airship landing and petition the elite flyer to transport you to the edge of the aether-soaked wasteland."
4,"TEXT_JOBSMN580_02104_SEQ_04","Your meditations in the Carteneau Flats are interrupted by the Ascian of the Twelfth Chalice, who vows to deny you the advantage of Bahamut's might. Despite the relentless onslaught of egi, however, you are able to complete the ritual and enter the trance of the dreadwyrm. Wary of your newfound strength, your immortal foe chooses to withdraw rather than risk defeat. Return to Ul'dah, and speak with Dancing Wolf at the Hall of Flames."
5,"TEXT_JOBSMN580_02104_SEQ_05","Though pleased with the success of your clandestine mission, Dancing Wolf is also frustrated at his failure to exact a proper vengeance. Y'mhitra reminds him, however, that the true destruction of an Ascian is not so easily accomplished. Explore the power of your Dreadwyrm Trance, and prepare yourself for your next confrontation with the malevolent Paragon.

※The next summoner quest will be available from Dancing Wolf upon reaching level 60."

55,"TEXT_JOBSMN580_02104_YMHITRA_000_013","When you summon an avatar, you draw upon your body's reservoir of aether to grant life and form to what is known as an arcane entity─that much we already knew."
56,"TEXT_JOBSMN580_02104_YMHITRA_000_014","I had, however, overlooked the simple fact that our aetheric reserves are finite─thus the magnitude of egi that you are able to summon is limited by the extent of your own life force. Simply put, if the egi is too powerful, then the summoning fails..."
57,"TEXT_JOBSMN580_02104_YMHITRA_000_015","But do not despair! The summoners of Allag devised a method by which one might circumvent this intrinsic limitation."
58,"TEXT_JOBSMN580_02104_YMHITRA_000_016","Rather than attempt to summon a separate, physical manifestation of certain egi, the most accomplished mages discovered that far less aether was required to infuse <Emphasis>themselves</Emphasis> with the essence of a primal's power.

The technique by which a summoner would achieve this heightened state was known as a “trance.”"

61,"TEXT_JOBSMN580_02104_YMHITRA_000_030","On the day of the Calamity, the dragon vanished in an explosion so massive that his aether was carried to the far corners of Eorzea. You, among many others, have already been touched by his essence."
62,"TEXT_JOBSMN580_02104_YMHITRA_000_040","All that remains is to perform the meditative ritual in a place steeped in Bahamut's energies, and you should be able to enter the trance of the dreadwyrm.

She petitioned me to help gain entry to the aether-soaked wasteland of the Carteneau Flats."
