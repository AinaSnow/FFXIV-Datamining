※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESSUM104_02127_SEQ_01","P'obyano eagerly explains that in order to receive her special reward, you must deliver to her seven Faire tokens. Complete various tasks around the beach, and return to P'obyano once you have gathered seven Faire tokens.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESSUM104_02127_SEQ_02","P'obyano happily accepts your Faire tokens, but before she can give you her reward, a burly Roegadyn pirate frightens the faire-goers on the beach away. Gegeruju, displeased that someone would dare to disturb his gazing, demands that something be done. P'obyano determines that the best course of action is to try and reach a peaceful resolution with the pirate, and requests your support. She asks you to go ahead and look for Wunthyll while she finds someone to run the stall in her absence."
3,"TEXT_FESSUM104_02127_SEQ_03","It appears Wunthyll is part of a group that was meant to settle the lands surrounding Bloodshore. The group worked hard to make an honest living, until one day Gegeruju bought the land, and the troubled settlers returned to a life of piracy. P'obyano sympathizes with the group's hardship, but insists that piracy is not the only way to make one's way in life. Sensing a golden opportunity, she suggests that the pirate join the Adventurers' Guild. The pirate is eventually convinced to seriously consider a change in careers, and even offers to tell his fellow pirates about the opportunity. P'obyano seems satisfied with this conclusion and returns to her duties at the faire, and from now on will treat pirates with the same consideration as other guests. With the main problems of the faire solved, now there is nothing left to do but revel in the beachfront festivities."
