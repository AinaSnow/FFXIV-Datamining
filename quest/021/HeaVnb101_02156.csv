0,"TEXT_HEAVNB101_02156_SEQ_00","Alphinaud wishes to share the latest developments in the search for the missing Scions."
1,"TEXT_HEAVNB101_02156_SEQ_01","Although there has been progress in the search for F'lhaminn, Yda, and Papalymo, the hunt for Minfilia and Thancred remains at a standstill. Fortunately, it would seem that one of the surviving Students of Baldesion is coming to aid you in your efforts. As much as he would like to stay and greet the Sharlayan scholar, Alphinaud─and you─have been summoned for a private audience with Ser Aymeric to discuss an undisclosed matter. Attend the lord commander at the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly forthwith."
2,"TEXT_HEAVNB101_02156_SEQ_02","Despite Ser Aymeric's decision to disclose the circumstances surrounding his father's disappearance, there is growing unrest in the city of Ishgard. Some dispute the lord commander's version of events, while many who do accept the truth question the measures taken to stop the archbishop. Still others have turned their ire on the clergy whom they claim were complicit in Thordan's deception. Desperate to secure a lasting peace, Ser Aymeric bids you escort Lucia to Anyx Trine, that she might treat with Vidofnir and thereby reestablish diplomatic relations with Hraesvelgr's brood."
3,"TEXT_HEAVNB101_02156_SEQ_03","Lucia admits to knowing little of Anyx Trine or its surrounding lands, and thanks you for agreeing to serve as her escort. As it may be some time before you return to the capital, Alphinaud thinks it best to notify Tataru of your plans prior to departing."
4,"TEXT_HEAVNB101_02156_SEQ_04","Tataru is heartened to learn of your diplomatic mission, and readily concedes that it should take precedence over receiving the Sharlayan scholar. Even so, she encourages you to join the welcoming party in Idyllshire should time permit, as the Sharlayan scholar in question is not just <Emphasis>anyone</Emphasis>... Before she can elaborate, however, Alphinaud loudly declares that you must return to the Congregation at once. Apparently, the first commander has been kept waiting long enough."
5,"TEXT_HEAVNB101_02156_SEQ_05","Lucia has finished her preparations and is eager to depart. With luck, this will be a momentous journey..."

50,"TEXT_HEAVNB101_02156_TATARU_000_003","Absolutely! You'll be pleased to hear that Riol and his men have been making excellent progress!"
51,"TEXT_HEAVNB101_02156_TATARU_000_004","You remember how F'lhaminn helped me to escape the Crystal Braves in Limsa Lominsa, only to then disappear? <Emphasis>Well</Emphasis>, according to Riol, she crept aboard a ship bound for Radz–at–Han, where she's been hiding ever since. He assures me that it won't be long before we're reunited."
52,"TEXT_HEAVNB101_02156_TATARU_000_005","As for Yda and Papalymo, the remains of their linkpearls have been found─and in <Emphasis>Pearl Lane</Emphasis> of all places. Riol thinks they must have disposed of them after escaping from the Royal Promenade."
53,"TEXT_HEAVNB101_02156_ALPHINAUD_000_006","Yes, that would make sense... They could not risk being eavesdropped upon by our betrayers."
54,"TEXT_HEAVNB101_02156_TATARU_000_007","We're all but certain they fled the city shortly after...though we still don't have a clue where they went."
55,"TEXT_HEAVNB101_02156_ALPHINAUD_000_008","I see. And what of Thancred and Minfilia?"
56,"TEXT_HEAVNB101_02156_TATARU_000_009","...I'm afraid I have nothing new to share about those two. But it's not all doom and gloom! The good news is, we've enlisted the services of a Sharlayan scholar─one of the Students of Baldesion─to aid in the search, who should be arriving any day now!"
57,"TEXT_HEAVNB101_02156_ALPHINAUD_000_010","One of the Students, you say? I should very much like to meet this scholar─if time permits."
58,"TEXT_HEAVNB101_02156_ALPHINAUD_000_011","But first we must attend to a more pressing matter. Ser Aymeric has summoned the two of us for a private audience. The messenger did not specify what he wished to discuss─only that it was urgent."
59,"TEXT_HEAVNB101_02156_ALPHINAUD_000_012","Assuming you have no objections, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, I suggest we proceed to the Congregation forthwith."

82,"TEXT_HEAVNB101_02156_TATARU_000_062","But should your meeting with Vidofnir happen to end early, you might consider rendezvousing with Y'shtola in Idyllshire. She'll be there to receive our guest."

84,"TEXT_HEAVNB101_02156_ALPHINAUD_000_064","<Emphasis>Time permitting</Emphasis>, as I said. We shall endeavor to join Y'shtola, but if we cannot, pray pass on our regards."
85,"TEXT_HEAVNB101_02156_ALPHINAUD_000_065","Let us be off, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. We have kept the first commander waiting long enough."

87,"TEXT_HEAVNB101_02156_ALPHINAUD_000_075","One task at a time, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Besides, I have no doubt that Y'shtola can look after the scholar by herself."
