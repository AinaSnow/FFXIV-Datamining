1,"TEXT_CHREND103_02154_SEQ_01","Bruvagnon explains to you that those who strive for a favorable position within the Holy See must first graduate from the scholasticate with the highest marks─as one of the Trinity, or the top three seats which receive a formal endorsement. However, due to the revelations regarding Ishgard's history, both the curriculum and the traditional means of assessment are currently being reevaluated. Without a clear path to the Trinity, the students have grown disillusioned and angry, with some lashing out at their peers."
2,"TEXT_CHREND103_02154_SEQ_02","You meet with Headmistress Elviane and the other clergy of the scholasticate, who relay to you and Briardien their wealth of concerns. While they acknowledge that the uncertainty regarding the rankings is partially to blame, they posit it is but part of a larger problem─a fundamental crisis of faith. That being said, the headmistress and her administrators are quite concerned that some students may attempt to manipulate the interim evaluation system to their advantage. Therefore, the administration would have you and Briardien remain vigilant for any unscrupulous behavior that they might conduct a fair and equitable assessment of the graduating seniors."
3,"TEXT_CHREND103_02154_SEQ_03","After the meeting with the headmistress, the soft-spoken clergyman introduces himself as Saturnois, a scholasticate instructor who often interacts with the underprivileged students of the seminary. Briardien surmises that it would be prudent to learn more about the students and their aspirations. Gaetelle and Saturnois suggest getting to know the students yourself, as they behave differently in the presence of their instructors. Gaetelle recommends starting with the dormitory prefect, Archombadin de Dzemael."
4,"TEXT_CHREND103_02154_SEQ_04","You speak with Archombadin de Dzemael and Lebrassoir de Bonfaurt, who express their opinions on the current turmoil in the Holy See, as well as their hope that the students of the scholasticate will rein in their impulses towards reformation. During your discussion, Archombadin mentions that Gaetelle has given them the task of guiding truant students back to their studies, and Briardien suspects others are doing the same."
5,"TEXT_CHREND103_02154_SEQ_05","In your search for other students, you come across Theomocent and Leigh, who intend to go to Foundation to coax their friends back to their studies. Theomocent is hopeful that they will be able to find like-minded students to support their cause, while Leigh's attitude is less optimistic. During your observations, you also meet a highborn student surrounded by his female admirers. He introduces himself as Crammevoix de Maintigny, and appears to have done well in his efforts to persuade a fellow seminarian to return. During a conversation between the two about the nobles taking more responsibility in redressing the imbalance, the smiling seminarian mentions she was to pen a treatise─that is, until her primary text, volume eleven of <Emphasis>The Seventy-two Articles of Halonic Polity</Emphasis>, went missing. Nevertheless, she leaves to gather her things and return to the seminary, prompting Crammevoix to take his leave for a nap. "
6,"TEXT_CHREND103_02154_SEQ_06","Gaetelle announces the results of the exercise, with Archombadin and Lebrassoir guiding back the most students to the scholasticate. Though present for the announcement, Crammevoix's name is not among those mentioned, and Archombadin soon makes it clear that the girl he was speaking with, Ulaa, has instead formally withdrawn from the scholasticate. Crammevoix is suspicious of Ulaa's sudden departure, mentioning the dormitory prefect's open disagreement with her views on equality. The quarrel between the highborn students escalates, in which Archombadin utters a biting comment about House Maintigny, prompting Crammevoix to leave. Upon witnessing the feud, Briardien suggests the girl's withdrawal is worthy of further investigation."

132,"TEXT_CHREND103_02154_ARCHOMBADIN_000_091","It brings me joy to see so many of our brothers and sisters returned to the scholasticate. Sister Gaetelle, the floor is yours."
133,"TEXT_CHREND103_02154_GAETELLE_000_092","Thank you, Archombadin. I will now announce how many of our stray sheep each student persuaded to come home."
134,"TEXT_CHREND103_02154_GAETELLE_000_093","Both Theomocent and Leigh were able to bring back one student each. Janchette guided two back into our arms."
135,"TEXT_CHREND103_02154_GAETELLE_000_094","Archombadin and Lebrassoir were each able to convince three students to return, the most of all. Excellent work, all of you."

140,"TEXT_CHREND103_02154_CRAMMEVOIX_000_096","Wait, Sister Gaetelle─what about Ulaa? She seemed quite enthusiastic about returning to her studies."
141,"TEXT_CHREND103_02154_ARCHOMBADIN_000_097","The girl you speak of has formally withdrawn from the scholasticate. Apparently she was not all that enthusiastic about returning as she led Crammevoix to believe. Mayhap she chose to play along so that he would cease his harassment."
142,"TEXT_CHREND103_02154_LEBRASSOIR_000_098","Perhaps it was for the best. She rarely engaged her fellow students, instead choosing to sit alone and read the <Emphasis>Articles of Halonic Polity</Emphasis>. Given the recent revelations, I suspect she became disillusioned with the faith."
143,"TEXT_CHREND103_02154_CRAMMEVOIX_000_099","Strange you would say that, Lebrassoir. When last I spoke with her, Ulaa was quite interested in volume eleven's “Equal under Her ever-watchful gaze” passage─one that you and your master would sooner pretend did not exist. If she were the victim of harassment, I rather expect it was at your hands."
144,"TEXT_CHREND103_02154_ARCHOMBADIN_000_100","Are you implying that we had something to do with it because we did not share her views? What rot! You dishonor yourself and your house with such baseless accusations─rather you would, if aught remained of your house to dishonor."

I lack the <Emphasis>qualities</Emphasis> the honorable Lord Archombadin possesses which enable him to deliver such observations. Well, if Ulaa has withdrawn, then I must mourn her departure─by walking through the dormitory halls reciting excerpts from volume eleven."
146,"TEXT_CHREND103_02154_LEBRASSOIR_000_102","And how do you intend to do that? Volume eleven of the <Emphasis>Articles of Halonic Polity</Emphasis> has been missing for some time now."
147,"TEXT_CHREND103_02154_CRAMMEVOIX_000_103","The tomes themselves are inconsequential if one has taken the words to heart. How fortunate we are that the wisdom of our forebears is not so easily forgotten, would you not agree?"
148,"TEXT_CHREND103_02154_ARCHOMBADIN_000_104","Such impudence as befits a sixth son. For all his failings, his father was wise to send him away."
149,"TEXT_CHREND103_02154_LEBRASSOIR_000_105","...At any rate, we are blessed that this handful of truants have returned to us. Truly, it is the Fury's will that we overcome these trials and tribulations, and move forward with a singular vision for the future."
150,"TEXT_CHREND103_02154_BRIARDIEN_000_106","A student with a keen interest in a controversial precept who withdraws without explanation. This seems rather odd to me as well. Mayhap it is worthy of our attention..."
