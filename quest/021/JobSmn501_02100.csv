1,"TEXT_JOBSMN501_02100_SEQ_01","Y'mhitra has presented her findings on the art of summoning to her peers, and tells you of the overwhelmingly positive reaction. In addition to a flood of offers to assist with her research, she has also been promised a contribution of several rare Allagan tomestones. Join Y'mhitra on her journey to Saint Coinach's Find, and speak with Rammbroes about the newly unearthed relics."
2,"TEXT_JOBSMN501_02100_SEQ_02","You call on Rammbroes at the scholars' camp in Mor Dhona, and he gladly surrenders several Allagan tomestones to Y'mhitra. After mentioning your role in defeating Leviathan, Ramuh, and Shiva, the anthropogeographer subsequently theorizes that you should now be capable of summoning forth new egi. Y'mhitra, jumping excitedly at this realization, presses her colleague for suggestions of suitable locations at which to attempt the rituals. Head to the Singing Shards, and join the researcher in the north of the area."
3,"TEXT_JOBSMN501_02100_SEQ_03","Your attempt to summon Ramuh-Egi in the Singing Shards has ended in failure. Return to Apkallu Falls, and discuss this unexpected development with Y'mhitra."
4,"TEXT_JOBSMN501_02100_SEQ_04","Even after examining her previous findings, Y'mhitra has been unable to ascertain the reason behind the failed ritual. She then promises to begin her study of the Allagan tomestones she received from Rammbroes, and asks that you prepare yourself, body and spirit, for the unknown challenges that lie ahead.

※The next summoner quest will be available from Y'mhitra upon reaching level 52."

50,"TEXT_JOBSMN501_02100_YMHITRA_000_002","I imagine that any summoning knowledge hidden within those relics would prove of great benefit to us both. Shall we journey out to Mor Dhona now, and pay a visit to Rammbroes?"

As ever, we here at Saint Coinach's Find remain firmly entrenched in our efforts to excavate the secrets of the Allagan Empire. The members of NOAH must be armed with knowledge if they are truly to pave the way to the future..."
54,"TEXT_JOBSMN501_02100_RAMMBROES_000_015","Well met! Without your invaluable cooperation, our research in the region would have ground to a highly unsatisfying halt."

58,"TEXT_JOBSMN501_02100_RAMMBROES_000_023","Leviathan, Ramuh, Shiva... With every new primal that appears, the importance of a thorough study of summoning magicks becomes ever more apparent."

62,"TEXT_JOBSMN501_02100_YMHITRA_000_027","Master Rammbroes! Can you suggest any places in which the aetheric balance tips heavily towards either water, lightning, or ice?"

72,"TEXT_JOBSMN501_02100_YMHITRA_000_044","...Well, there is little point in us remaining here if Ramuh-Egi will not answer your call. Shall we return to Gridania?"
73,"TEXT_JOBSMN501_02100_YMHITRA_000_050","Hello, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I scoured my research notes for a hint as to why the summoning failed, but there were no revelations to be found."
74,"TEXT_JOBSMN501_02100_YMHITRA_000_051","I am forced to conclude that the cause must lie outside our current understanding of the art. Thus shall I begin studying the tomestones we received from Rammbroes, and hope they contain some heretofore unknown wisdom."
75,"TEXT_JOBSMN501_02100_YMHITRA_000_052","Mayhap these new egi require a different manner of catalyst...? While I delve into this mystery, I suggest you continue practicing your art─we enter an uncharted realm of summoning and you must be prepared, body and spirit."
