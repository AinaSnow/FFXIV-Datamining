To think of a marvel so strange or so tall,♪
A steely skinned giant whose veins coursed with steam,♪
In whose bright burnished bosom foul goblins did scheme,♪
A heaven to they who therein did dwell,♪
But one whose mere being made all else a hell.♪"

Conspiring at last to rend it apart.♪
His core being no more, the giant fell still,♪
Though the goblins remained there to plot further ill...♪"
