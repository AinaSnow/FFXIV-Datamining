Alphinaud, Y'shtola, and Tataru will focus their efforts on Foundation and the Brume, while you, Thancred, and Hilda will begin by questioning the residents of the Pillars─starting with one Lord Emmanellain de Fortemps, who is a notorious gossip."

As Alphinaud watches him leave, he observes that the young nobleman is not in the best of spirits. To this, Lucia responds that given the rumors circulating about his father and the untimely passing of his half-brother, it would be strange if he were otherwise.
