※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANVAN007_02170_SEQ_01","A party of Vundu has been spotted approaching Ok' Zundu, and Linu Vali steels herself to meet them on the field of battle. However, she asks that you present yourself before the Gundu totem pole and perform the /sundropdance before facing the Vundu. By doing so, the ancestors of the Gundu tribe will grant today's warriors the will to achieve victory.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."

3,"TEXT_BANVAN007_02170_SEQ_03","Linu Vali is emboldened by the news of her ancestors' blessing, and is ready to confront the Vundu forthwith. After thanking you for everything you have done for the Gundu, she states that today's battle should be left to the Vanu Vanu to settle, and asks that you go to Ok' Zundu to tell Sonu Vanu that the group's preparations are complete."

You are to stand watch over the battle, so that you may tell the tale of the Zundu and Gundu tribes' last stand should the Vundu emerge victorious. Go to the northeast, where the Vundu have been sighted, and wait for the Vanu Vanu to arrive."
5,"TEXT_BANVAN007_02170_SEQ_05","You watch the fateful encounter from above the fields, and see the Vundu come face-to-face with the group of Gundu and Zundu, who respond to the Vundu chieftain's demands with a booming display of their sundrop dance. The Vundu seem unaffected, however, accepting the challenge with their own dance. Succumbing to the Vundu's ferocity, the Gundu and Zundu dancers lose the will to continue. Refusing to leave your allies to their fate, you descend from your position and show the Vundu your own sundrop dance. The Vundu are taken aback by your fury, and the Zundu and Gundu are inspired to match your steps. The renewed power of the sundrop dance strikes fear into the hearts of the Vundu, and they flee back to their village in defeat. With the Gundu and Zundu tribes victorious, they depart into the sunset to celebrate their newfound freedom."
