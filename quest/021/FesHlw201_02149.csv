※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESHLW201_02149_SEQ_01","An investigator from the Adventurers' Guild has asked your help in uncovering the nefarious plans of the Continental Circus─a troupe of mischievous fiends disguised as entertainers. Approach the illusionists outside Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre, and learn what you can of their impending devilry.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESHLW201_02149_SEQ_02","You speak with the festive illusionists, but they are quick to turn you away. Whatever malevolent plan they have for this year's All Saints' Wake seems to revolve around the participation of the city's children. Report your findings to the Adventurers' Guild investigator."
3,"TEXT_FESHLW201_02149_SEQ_03","Upon digesting the information you gleaned from the illusionists, the investigator is struck by the force of his terrible imaginings. What manner of dark mischief could the Continental Circus be planning...?"

49,"TEXT_FESHLW201_02149_GODRIQUELAIN_000_001","The business of which I speak involves keeping an eye on that troublesome troupe of entertainers─the Continental Circus."
50,"TEXT_FESHLW201_02149_GODRIQUELAIN_000_002","One might wonder why this particular group of performers concerned us so...until one beheld their true fiendish forms. Aye, there is naught more terrifying than the monster who hides behind the face of a man."

52,"TEXT_FESHLW201_02149_GODRIQUELAIN_000_004","In the interests of maintaining a semblance of order, however, the guild would have us quell the Circus's efforts to instigate chaos─discreetly, of course."
53,"TEXT_FESHLW201_02149_GODRIQUELAIN_000_005","Unfortunately, it would appear that covert operations are not my forte. The fiends have grown leery of my clumsy interrogations, and I am in need of a capable replacement. Will you, then, perform the duty that I could not?"
54,"TEXT_FESHLW201_02149_GODRIQUELAIN_000_006","Excellent! Your first task shall be to engage the troupe's illusionists in conversation, and skillfully prise forth their nefarious plans. May you fare better in your efforts than I!"

66,"TEXT_FESHLW201_02149_GODRIQUELAIN_000_031","Hmmm, so they seek to lure the younglings to Hyrstmill with the promise of costumes and sweets. Why, any manner of terrible plot could unfold so far from the safety of the city..."
