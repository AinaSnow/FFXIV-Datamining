Though he claims to admire your “work,” he observes that, because you do not undertake such trials by yourself, it must be difficult to tell if you are pulling your weight. He too has such worries, which is why he has been training in Stone, Sky, Sea─a new training ground of some repute, of which a goodly adventurer outside Idyllshire can tell you more."
