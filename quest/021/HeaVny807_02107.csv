49,"TEXT_HEAVNY807_02107_KESTERIRONHEART_000_001","Ahem. Forgive me─I got carried away for a moment. I am Kester Ironheart, cousin to Millith and an explorer of sorts, like most of my extended family."
50,"TEXT_HEAVNY807_02107_KESTERIRONHEART_000_002","When I last spoke with Millith, she told me of an adventurer with a keen case of wanderlust─an adventurer that I know now to be you. What say you lend me your log for a moment? Don't worry─I won't eat it or anything."
51,"TEXT_HEAVNY807_02107_KESTERIRONHEART_000_003","There, there, and yes─there! That should do it, I reckon."
52,"TEXT_HEAVNY807_02107_KESTERIRONHEART_000_004","It's no secret that Ishgard is home to some of the most remarkable sights in our realm. Mind you, I've not seen them all myself, but I certainly know where they might be found. And now, so do you─thanks to the notes and rumors I've seen fit to jot down in your sightseeing log."
53,"TEXT_HEAVNY807_02107_KESTERIRONHEART_000_005","Yes, scores of stunning vistas are just waiting to be discovered. Your legs will not carry you to all of them, though. Should you find a particular spot out of reach, you might consider taking to the skies atop a black-feathered bird."
54,"TEXT_HEAVNY807_02107_KESTERIRONHEART_000_007","...Oho, but if I were to say more, I would be robbing you of the joy of discovering these spectacular views for yourself. Godsspeed, my fellow explorer, and may this moment mark the beginning of a tour of wonder!"
