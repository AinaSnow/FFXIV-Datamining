1,"TEXT_BANVAN001_02164_SEQ_01","Sonu Vanu is grateful for your return to Ok' Zundu, for as if by heavenly coincidence, something is troubling him that only a courageous adventurer can help with. Zundu spies have reported unusual amounts of activity from Ok' Vundu Mok, in the heart of Vundu territory. The Zundu chief is anxious as to what this might mean for his tribe, but cannot risk the uneasy truce with the Vundu by sending his own spies. He asks that you make your way to Ok' Vundu Mok to ascertain what is causing the furor.

You stand fearless before the dance, however, and leap to the defense of the shivering Vanu."

Linu Vali is ecstatic at this present, promising that the Gundu will be self-sufficient, and work to make a new settlement free from Vundu influence.

She asks for your help in building up the Gundu's new home. Your agreement encourages her, and she dubs the new village “Ok' Gundu Nakki.” Eager to get started on construction, she asks you to speak with Muna Vanu to learn what tasks are required of you.
