2,"TEXT_BANVAN204_02184_SEQ_02","Eenu Vanu tells you that Vundu cloudfishers have been greedily snatching up all the plump fish, leaving very few to feed the villagers of Ok' Gundu Nakki. He asks you to ride on sanuwa-back to the fishing spot near Neverreap in the east and stop the cloudfishers from bleeding the Sea of Clouds dry. Approach Luna Vanu and ask him to lend you one of his cloudkin for the journey."
