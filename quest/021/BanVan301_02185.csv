※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level."
1,"TEXT_BANVAN301_02185_SEQ_01","Muna Vanu is concerned with how long the construction of new Gundu huts is taking. He asks that you speak with the resident builder, Ginu Vanu, and see what can be done to help things along.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest."
2,"TEXT_BANVAN301_02185_SEQ_02","Ginu Vanu explains that the construction materials available are not conducive to expedient work. Good, steel nails, like those used by the Rose Knights, would help him finish his work much more quickly. To acquire said nails, he plans to offer them meat from tsanahales in exchange. This meat is at its most delicious─and valuable─immediately after being butchered, so you will need to slay the beasts yourself. Ginu Vanu recommends using wamoura, found on an island to the south, as bait to draw them out."
3,"TEXT_BANVAN301_02185_SEQ_03","After surveying a nearby island as Ginu Vanu suggested, you happen upon the remains of a recently deceased wamoura, saving you the trouble of slaying one yourself. Head further south to Provenance and use the wamoura meat to lure out two tsanahales."

5,"TEXT_BANVAN301_02185_SEQ_05","You present Fabrellet with the Gundu's trade proposition. Seeing the fresh tsanahale meat, he agrees without a second thought. Handing over enough nails to meet any needs Ginu Vanu might have, he assures you that Camp Cloudtop would be more than willing to trade again in future. Return to Ok' Gundu Nakki with your hard-earned nails."
6,"TEXT_BANVAN301_02185_SEQ_06","Ginu Vanu is taken aback by the quantity of steel nails the Rose Knights offered in exchange for meat. Now able to employ proper fasteners in his woodworking, Ginu Vanu is sure that any hut he builds will be capable of weathering even the harshest conditions."
