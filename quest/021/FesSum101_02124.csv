※This quest is available for a limited time only."
1,"TEXT_FESSUM101_02124_SEQ_01","Once again it is time for the Moonfire Faire, and the Adventurers' Guild is in need of extra hands to help make it the most memorable one yet. Haermaga has asked you to assist the chaperones at Costa del Sol with the many problems they are facing. Help the guild with the faire by reporting to the chaperone P'obyano to hear what it is she requires from you.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone."
2,"TEXT_FESSUM101_02124_SEQ_02","P'obyano happily explains that the Adventurers' Guild has no shortage of work for an eager volunteer. A few difficulties are bound to occur during a celebration as exciting as the Moonfire Faire, and right now P'obyano is dealing with unruly pirates, dirty beaches, inquisitive beasts, and hungry customers. Anyone willing to lend their aid can receive Faire tokens as a reward. Choose the tasks most suitable for yourself and ensure that the Moonfire Faire proceeds without a hitch."
