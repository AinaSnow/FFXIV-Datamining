4,"TEXT_JOBMNK350_01062_SEQ_04","It seems that the aetherometer in your keeping suffered some damage on your latest outing. Professor Erik asks that you visit him again later after he has time to see to its repairs and determine where next to send you in search of aetherial data.

※The next monk quest will be available from Erik upon reaching level 40."

49,"TEXT_JOBMNK350_01062_ERIK_000_001","Right, well, let us measure some aether, shall we? And by we I mean you. Oh, and the monk simpleton, of course. Though, contrary to his nature, he has already set out for the destination I assigned him."
50,"TEXT_JOBMNK350_01062_ERIK_000_002","Thinking perhaps that you are far too stupid to take, much less understand, aetheric readings? It is true─you are stupid. But the aetherometer shall do all the work for you, and transmit the data back to me. "
51,"TEXT_JOBMNK350_01062_ERIK_000_003","As souls more, ahem, <Emphasis>suited to action</Emphasis>, the monk simpleton and yourself need only carry the device on your person and set about beating on things as you always do. It shall capture data as you trudge about hither and yon."
52,"TEXT_JOBMNK350_01062_ERIK_000_004","Aether is not only the source of all magicks, but also the fount of all life. Yet despite its ubiquity, it remains imperceptible. When a living thing dies, the aether comprising its life is released. When this discharge takes place, a portion of that aether remains, lingering in the physical world."

55,"TEXT_JOBMNK350_01062_ERIK_000_007","In short: the more violent and dramatic the loss of life, the greater the amount of aether left behind, either in its imperceptible form or in crystallizations. And where are the most lives lost in this manner?"
56,"TEXT_JOBMNK350_01062_ERIK_000_008","Cemeteries!? No, false, you idiot! Battlefields! Do you not see? With aetheric readings of those locations, we can discern the scale and more of the battles that took place there!"
57,"TEXT_JOBMNK350_01062_ERIK_000_009","As for those fool beliefs the monkhood keeps─chakra and spiritual energies and whatnot─if I <Emphasis>were</Emphasis> to allow that they truly exist, I would be inclined to say they are one and the same as aether itself."
58,"TEXT_JOBMNK350_01062_ERIK_000_010","The aether churning around these ancient battle sites comes to naturally settle in the surrounding life─both plant and animal, though more so in the latter. It accumulates within them. Felling these beasts then releases that aether, causing a surge that resonates with the aether within you, causing it to expand─the so-called opening of the chakra. By this, the very power of life itself within you grows."

66,"TEXT_JOBMNK350_01062_ERIK_000_022","My aetherometer is no ordinary device. I came up with the elaborate design myself, had the finest engineers at Garlond Ironworks draft the schematics, and then commissioned the most talented goldsmiths to fabricate it."
67,"TEXT_JOBMNK350_01062_ERIK_000_023","Widargelt delivered the results of his outing not long ago. I must insist that you take your leave of me now. There is a wealth of data for me to analyze, and I fear that simply having you nearby will somehow affect the processing power of my brain."
