Make for Everschade and quell the fury of the Guardian Tree."

However, before all hope is lost, A–Towa–Cant himself appears from out of the aether to fight alongside you. After a grueling battle, the great mage is again forced back into his aetherial slumber, but not before entrusting the future of the Twelveswood to you and the Seedseers. With peace returned at last, return to Camp Tranquil and speak with Raya–O–Senna."

In recognition of your accomplishments as a white mage, she bestows upon you the last piece of your garb─now imbued with the power of the departed A–Towa–Cant─and imparts unto you the most powerful incantation she knows. Expressing her confidence that you will bring succor to the realm and do her people proud, she wishes you well in your journeys.
