2,"TEXT_JOBDRG300_01067_SEQ_02","Ser Alberic has enlisted your aid in tracking down the Eye, a priceless Ishgardian relic that has been spirited away by a rogue dragoon named Estinien. Consult with Logedanrel for insight as to where the fugitive may have traveled."
3,"TEXT_JOBDRG300_01067_SEQ_03","Logedanrel suggests that you speak to the sentry Idristan at Florentel's Spire and inquire as to whether he has seen a man matching Estinien's description."

6,"TEXT_JOBDRG300_01067_SEQ_06","Upon searching the campfire, you were ambushed by a dragoon clad in black steel. Return to Ser Alberic and tell him of your encounter."
7,"TEXT_JOBDRG300_01067_SEQ_07","Upon hearing of your encounter, Ser Alberic confesses to you the truth. The dragoon you encountered was indeed Estinien, who is no ordinary thief, but rather the Azure Dragoon─the chosen one─and a former pupil of Ser Alberic's. Convinced that you have been chosen by the Eye, Ser Alberic tasks you with retrieving the relic from Estinien.

※The next dragoon quest will be available from Alberic upon reaching level 35."
