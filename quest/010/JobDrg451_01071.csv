51,"TEXT_JOBDRG451_01071_ALBERIC_000_003","What I said was an untruth. The power did not abandon me, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. It was I who abandoned it."
52,"TEXT_JOBDRG451_01071_ALBERIC_000_004","Being derived from our mortal enemies, the power of the Azure Dragoon is a double-edged sword. Even as it lends us the strength we need to smite dragons, it heightens our communion with the creatures, rendering our minds more susceptible to their seduction than ordinary men."
53,"TEXT_JOBDRG451_01071_ALBERIC_000_005","Even as I buried my lance in Nidhogg's flesh, our gazes locked, and mine eyes met then with a look that would fair impale a man. In that instant, I found myself assailed by a torrent of emotions not mine own..."

60,"TEXT_JOBDRG451_01071_ALBERIC_000_012","That frame of mind, I fear, may well lead to his demise. The desire to protect and the desire to avenge are opposing forces that can ill be reconciled. Worse, the latter serves only to cloud his sense of self."
61,"TEXT_JOBDRG451_01071_ALBERIC_000_013","When next Estinien and I meet, I intend to confess all, though it mean the loss of his good opinion. The outcome of the coming battle─and his very life─may well depend upon his readiness to relinquish his powers."

65,"TEXT_JOBDRG451_01071_ALBERIC_000_017","No, you must claim the technique much as you claimed the fourth piece of the armor you bear─by proving yourself in battle with the dragons whose power you would unite with your own."
66,"TEXT_JOBDRG451_01071_ALBERIC_000_018","I entrust you with this flute once more. Take it to the southwest of Providence Point and blow a single note. By locking wills with your adversary and prevailing, you will prove yourself worthy to champion the cause to which your lance is sworn. The dragon within you shall then awaken."

70,"TEXT_JOBDRG451_01071_ALBERIC_000_023","That said, I yet have reservations. The sheer power of the dragon housed within is such that a great many of your Azure forebears─myself among them─have proven hopelessly incapable of wielding it."
71,"TEXT_JOBDRG451_01071_ALBERIC_000_024","But I do not doubt what I see. Aye, within you has awakened a strength that forever eluded the likes of me. If you are not worthy of wearing the armor, then I know none who are."
72,"TEXT_JOBDRG451_01071_ALBERIC_000_025","Remember my warning to you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, and heed it well. Nidhogg is a lord among his kind. Aught less than complete conviction, and you will surely fall under his thrall."
73,"TEXT_JOBDRG451_01071_ALBERIC_000_026","Before you can master your foe, you must needs master yourself. Hone your lance arm till it can bear no further honing, and then present yourself to me. When the time is come, I will tell you what you need to know."
