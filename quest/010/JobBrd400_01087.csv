49,"TEXT_JOBBRD400_01087_JEHANTEL_000_001","This is an odd time for recollection, but it was a spring day when a bard first came to my hometown. He played the most sorrowful chords, even as his words tantalized the ear like the breath of one's first love. Many a maiden's heart was stolen during his visit...and doubtless more besides."
50,"TEXT_JOBBRD400_01087_JEHANTEL_000_002","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Would you believe that common bards, too, were born of archers? This may seem far-fetched upon first hearing, but it isn't so far a stretch."
51,"TEXT_JOBBRD400_01087_JEHANTEL_000_003","Ask yourself this: what becomes of soldiers when conflict gives way to peacetime? Some have lives they might return to, aye, but most must needs take up a new trade to make ends meet. Well, it so happened that many who had once bent the bow took to strumming the harp."
52,"TEXT_JOBBRD400_01087_JEHANTEL_000_004","They wandered the realm, singing passionately and earnestly of the war as seen through their own eyes─of sweet victories and bitter defeats, of sacrifice and cowardice. Their songs so captured the imagination of the people, nary a day passed that a bard was not called to perform, be it in a humble tavern or some great lord's hall."
53,"TEXT_JOBBRD400_01087_JEHANTEL_000_005","Alas, their popularity proved their downfall. Intoxicated by the attentions of the masses, the bards took to embellishing their songs in a bid to outdo one another."
54,"TEXT_JOBBRD400_01087_JEHANTEL_000_006","And over time, each song was shorn of verity, till the bard's repertoire contained not one shred of truth."
55,"TEXT_JOBBRD400_01087_JEHANTEL_000_007","By now you will know that such songs have no purchase upon men's hearts. Certainly, a bawdy tune may set off fits of laughter in a sailor, and a sorrowful ballad summon tears from the eyes of a soft-hearted maiden. Yet these are but pale shadows of what songs can achieve."
56,"TEXT_JOBBRD400_01087_JEHANTEL_000_008","For a blessing, this decline did not escape the notice of the moogles. As great patrons of the arts, they feared that the true power of song might be lost to mankind."
57,"TEXT_JOBBRD400_01087_JEHANTEL_000_009","So it was that they labored to gather and safeguard those crystals known as Souls of the Bard, that they might be bestowed upon worthy men and women."
