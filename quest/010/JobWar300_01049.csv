When your inner beast awakens, he explains, the runes will resonate, granting you such strength as you never thought possible. Hone your skills until such time as Curious Gorge can decipher the chronicles of his ancestors that he carries with him, and thereby continue your training.

※The next warrior quest will be available from Curious Gorge upon reaching level 35."
