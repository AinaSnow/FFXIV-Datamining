1,"TEXT_JOBSCH300_01097_SEQ_01","Though marauders are not known for their academic pursuits, one such marauder named Alka Zolka seeks an arcanist to assist him with his archaeological research. Should curiosity overwhelm you, he can be found at the Coral Tower in Limsa Lominsa."
2,"TEXT_JOBSCH300_01097_SEQ_02","Alka Zolka's interest in history is a practical one, as he seeks to research the military tactics of Nym, an ancient civilization said to have repulsed would-be invaders time and time again. He had hoped that an arcanist might help analyze any text pertaining to magical arts─that is, if he were in possession of any texts to translate. Alas, the Nymian tablets he purchased were stolen en route to Limsa Lominsa. Journey to the Raincatcher Gully docks in eastern La Noscea, where he suspects the thieves may be found, and help him recover his stolen relics."
3,"TEXT_JOBSCH300_01097_SEQ_03","As predicted, the thieves and the relics were both found at the docks. However, Alka Zolka had not anticipated the appearance of an otherworldly creature, one which seemingly burst forth from a crystal you found with the tablets. Hastily translating one of the tablets, Alka Zolka explains that the creature is a faerie, one which once served as the companion of a Nymian scholar. Ask the shocked marauder what he would like to do next."
4,"TEXT_JOBSCH300_01097_SEQ_04","Eager to discover what other secrets the tablets contain, Alka Zolka quickly departs for Limsa Lominsa. Perhaps by the time you return to the Coral Tower, he will have learned something new."
5,"TEXT_JOBSCH300_01097_SEQ_05","Alka Zolka explains that the crystal you found was the Soul of the Scholar, and that with it, you can call upon the faerie at will. Reasoning that an experienced arcanist would be in a better position to preserve the lost arts, he decides to entrust the crystal to you. Do your utmost to gain mastery over your newfound powers as the marauder continues to decipher the ancient tablets.

※The next scholar quest will be available from Alka Zolka upon reaching level 35."
