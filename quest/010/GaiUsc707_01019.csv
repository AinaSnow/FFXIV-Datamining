Travel to Iron Lake and use the makeshift bombs provided by the commander to blow up piles of kobold supplies to draw their attention away from the primary target."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSC707_01019_SEQ_02","You have destroyed the kobold supplies as per your orders. Return to Bloeidin and inquire as to the success of the mission."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSC707_01019_SEQ_03","Bloeidin informs you that, thanks in no small part to your efforts, the operation was a success. The loss of their crucible should take the wind out of the kobolds' sails for the foreseeable future."
