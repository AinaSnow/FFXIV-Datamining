1,"TEXT_JOBWAR451_01053_SEQ_01","Despite his misgivings about your ability to fully control its power, Curious Gorge shares with you the location of the final piece of his ancestors' lost armor. Seek it out in the waters of the Weeping Saint in the central highlands of Coerthas. Curious Gorge, recent experiences still weighing heavily on his heart, will stay behind."
2,"TEXT_JOBWAR451_01053_SEQ_02","No sooner had you taken the armor into hand than did Curious Gorge appear to claim it from you with nary a word of explanation. What has brought about this change of heart from your mentor? Return to Hidden Falls to seek an explanation."
3,"TEXT_JOBWAR451_01053_SEQ_03","Curious Gorge offers his apology for his actions, explaining that he cannot trust you, himself, or anyone to wear the armor until the would-be wearer's strength is demonstrated beyond a shadow of a doubt. He bids you to return to your training while he studies the texts to see how such strength might be proven.

※The next warrior quest will be available from Curious Gorge upon reaching level 50."
