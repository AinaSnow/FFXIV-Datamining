1,"TEXT_JOBBLM300_01073_SEQ_01","Yayake of Arrzaneth Ossuary has asked you to ascertain the truth of a prophecy being spoken by one Ququruka, a prisoner who claims to hear the voice of Nald'thal. To do this, proceed to Highbridge in eastern Thanalan and investigate the planar fissure that is said to be there. Once looked into, fell any fiends that emerge, and secure a vial of their blood."

3,"TEXT_JOBBLM300_01073_SEQ_03","After pouring the voidsent blood into the planar fissure, an Amalj'aa named Kazagg Chah appears and presents you with the Gem of Shatotto. Take the gem and word of your feat back to Yayake at the Thaumaturges' Guild."
4,"TEXT_JOBBLM300_01073_SEQ_04","Yayake is surprised to see that the so-called “prophecy” carried with it some legitimacy, but is even more surprised when the prophecy maker himself, Ququruka, makes an appearance in the guild. After hurling a few well-timed insults in Yayake's general direction, the self-proclaimed black mage bids you proceed to Milvaneth Sacrarium. Once there, speak with his companion, Lalai."
5,"TEXT_JOBBLM300_01073_SEQ_05","Upon arriving at the Sacrarium, you learn that Ququruka is preoccupied with his meditations, and has entrusted Lalai with guiding you along the path of the black mage. Continue your study into the black arts, and return when you feel the arcane might within you has grown.

※The next black mage quest will be available from Lalai upon reaching level 35."

49,"TEXT_JOBBLM300_01073_YAYAKE_000_001","In prison, a man will do most anything to keep his mind occupied. Of late, one inmate claims to hear the voice of Nald'thal. No doubt he has lost his mind after serving one hundred years of a life sentence."
