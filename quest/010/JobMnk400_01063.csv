2,"TEXT_JOBMNK400_01063_SEQ_02","Widargelt urges you to set about your second task, assuring you that he will bring you his aetherometer when it has finished collecting data. Travel to Snakemolt in the South Shroud and make use of your aetherometer at the designated location."

4,"TEXT_JOBMNK400_01063_SEQ_04","Widargelt confesses that his sole purpose is to learn the locations of ancient battlefields from Professor Erik, so that he may travel to them in order to further open his chakra. In doing so, he hopes to serve the Ala Mhigan Resistance to the utmost of his ability. Return to the Goldsmiths' Guild and deliver both your and Widargelt's aetherometers to the professor."
5,"TEXT_JOBMNK400_01063_SEQ_05","Upon a cursory examination of the aetherometers, Professor Erik is excited by the prospective results they might yield. Continue in your monk's training as he sees about analyzing the latest haul of data.
