1,"TEXT_JOBWAR450_01052_SEQ_01","From his continued study of the ancient texts, Curious Gorge has ascertained the final resting places of three pieces of his ancestors' lost armor. Travel to Boulder Downs in Coerthas, Camp Tranquil in the South Shroud, and Parata's Peace in western Thanalan to unearth the relics."
2,"TEXT_JOBWAR450_01052_SEQ_02","You have gathered three pieces of the lost armor of Curious Gorge's tribe. Return to Hidden Falls and speak with your mentor."
3,"TEXT_JOBWAR450_01052_SEQ_03","Curious Gorge would see you don the relics you have obtained. Equip the armor and speak with your mentor once more."
4,"TEXT_JOBWAR450_01052_SEQ_04","Curious Gorge is most impressed after seeing the armor upon you. He tells you that he also found one of the remaining two pieces, but the warrior is unsure of its legitimacy. While he attempts to reason out what is wrong, you should continue your search for the next relic, which he believes to be sealed away at Red Mantis Falls."
5,"TEXT_JOBWAR450_01052_SEQ_05","You have indeed found a fourth relic at Red Mantis Falls, just as Curious Gorge surmised. Return to Hidden Falls and inform your mentor."
6,"TEXT_JOBWAR450_01052_SEQ_06","Having done further research with the ancient texts, Curious Gorge now understands why the relic he found did not respond to him. The events at Wineport drained his soul crystal of its vibrance, causing the armor to deny him its powers, lest his soul in its weakened state be devoured. Your mentor, having feared such a possibility, left the breastplate where it lay. While he has more confidence in <Emphasis>your</Emphasis> ability to control it, he would make certain you are prepared before seeking it yourself. When you feel you are ready, speak with him again."

48,"TEXT_JOBWAR450_01052_CURIOUSGORGE_000_000","Welcome again, my friend. I was wondering when your travels would bring you back this way. It just so happens that I have some exciting news."
49,"TEXT_JOBWAR450_01052_CURIOUSGORGE_000_001","I have finally uncovered the clues pertaining to the whereabouts of the lost armor of my ancestors! As it turns out, after the fallen hero cast the five pieces from the mountaintop, five of his pupils set out to recover them, intending to restore their master's name."
50,"TEXT_JOBWAR450_01052_CURIOUSGORGE_000_002","What is more, they were actually successful in this search. However, when it came to reuniting the set, the armor's great power began to work upon their minds, and not one could bring himself to relinquish his piece."
51,"TEXT_JOBWAR450_01052_CURIOUSGORGE_000_12","Realizing then that their master's fatal pride was born of the artifacts' combined influence, the pupils resolved to keep the pieces separate, and to share between five the power that might otherwise have consumed one. Thus did each of them carve his own place in history.
The chronicles go on to say that years later, prior to death, each of the pupils returned to the scene of his own greatest victory, and buried the artifact in his possession in a final attempt to prevent any one warrior from holding the set. And it is there that the pieces still rest."
52,"TEXT_JOBWAR450_01052_CURIOUSGORGE_000_13","You may be interested to know that the armor I wear is itself a replica of the set crafted by my ancestors─identical in all respects save for its lack of the arcane enchantments that adorned the original."
53,"TEXT_JOBWAR450_01052_CURIOUSGORGE_000_14","I know what you might be thinking: if we were to bring the five pieces together once more, what would prevent <Emphasis>us</Emphasis> from being corrupted in the same fashion? Well, I've thought of that! What we need only do is trace the runes we find on the armor onto <Emphasis>every</Emphasis> piece of warrior gear!
That way, there would be no need to worry about a single proud fool becoming drunk on his all-surpassing power, as every warrior in the realm would be possessed of the selfsame might!"
54,"TEXT_JOBWAR450_01052_CURIOUSGORGE_000_15","It's quite brilliant, if I do say so myself. So, how about we split up and begin the search straightaway? Three of the locations seem quite self-evident─I would entrust the search there to you while I track down the other two with tome in hand."
55,"TEXT_JOBWAR450_01052_CURIOUSGORGE_000_16","One piece is said to be buried under the great rocks of Boulder Downs in Coerthas, while another slumbers peacefully at Camp Tranquil in the South Shroud. The last of the three rests untouched at Parata's Peace in western Thanalan."
56,"TEXT_JOBWAR450_01052_CURIOUSGORGE_000_17","Unearth those three relics, and bring them to me. With any measure of fortune, I'll have tracked down the remaining two by the time of your return."
57,"TEXT_JOBWAR450_01052_CURIOUSGORGE_000_020","How fares your search, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? Have you found aught of my tribe's ancient relics? Should you have the three pieces of armor, don them and show them to me."
58,"TEXT_JOBWAR450_01052_CURIOUSGORGE_000_030","Ah, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. That you found the gear is most gratifying, but what I would truly fancy would be to see you in it."
59,"TEXT_JOBWAR450_01052_SYSTEM_100_030","Equip yourself with the three pieces of armor before speaking with Curious Gorge."
60,"TEXT_JOBWAR450_01052_SYSTEM_110_030","In the event that you have lost one or more of these items, you can return to where you obtained them and acquire them anew."
61,"TEXT_JOBWAR450_01052_CURIOUSGORGE_000_031","Wait...stand still for a moment. The armor so becomes you that I could not tell you had it on at first glance. But now I can have no doubt─I sense the power of the runes inscribed on each piece resonating with your soul crystal. This is the long-lost armor of the warrior."
62,"TEXT_JOBWAR450_01052_CURIOUSGORGE_000_032","I, too, have found one of the relics, but I have run into an unexpected rub. When I donned the piece, I felt nothing─as if the lost treasure were no different from the unadorned replicas already in my possession."
63,"TEXT_JOBWAR450_01052_CURIOUSGORGE_000_033","Whether the power has been lost to it, or must needs be awakened by means yet unknown to me, this I cannot say. The ancient texts still hold many mysteries beyond my ability to decipher..."
64,"TEXT_JOBWAR450_01052_CURIOUSGORGE_000_034","But before I forget, I should mention to you that I did indeed track down another piece before I was waylaid by this current conundrum. You should find it sealed away at Red Mantis Falls."
65,"TEXT_JOBWAR450_01052_CURIOUSGORGE_000_040","I see your search was a fruitful one. I am pleased to say I have also gleaned some insight into why the armor I found seemed devoid of power."
66,"TEXT_JOBWAR450_01052_CURIOUSGORGE_000_041","As I alluded to, the ancient warrior's armor derives its power from a concordance between the incantations engraved on the steel itself, and the inner beast of the wearer."
67,"TEXT_JOBWAR450_01052_CURIOUSGORGE_000_042","But my own resonance with the plating was too weak as to allow a proper connection with it...and now I think I know why: my soul crystal. It once burned bright like yours, but since the events at Wineport, it has been reduced to a lifeless husk."
68,"TEXT_JOBWAR450_01052_CURIOUSGORGE_000_044","Why this happened, I cannot say. But the tome is quite clear about what would happen were the powers of the armor to be bestowed upon one whose soul is weak. The inner beast would devour the mind of the wearer, who would go on a mindless rampage that would end only with the mercy of death."
69,"TEXT_JOBWAR450_01052_CURIOUSGORGE_000_045","Yes, not unlike the crazed fiends we battle."
70,"TEXT_JOBWAR450_01052_CURIOUSGORGE_000_046","I believe that the armor sensed my weakened state, foresaw the potential danger, and then knowingly shut off its powers to me... And I daresay we are fortunate that it did."
71,"TEXT_JOBWAR450_01052_CURIOUSGORGE_000_047","I feel as though an apology is in order at this juncture─I must tell you I left this final piece of the armor where I found it. The breastplate, as the piece closest to the warrior's heart, has powers far greater and more dangerous than the other pieces.
Uncertain as I was to the reason for my being unable to connect with the plate's mystical energy, I feared to take it would mean imperiling both myself and those around me."
72,"TEXT_JOBWAR450_01052_CURIOUSGORGE_000_048","Your soul may burn stronger than mine, yet still I worry for your fate were you to put it on. Look deep within yourself, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. When you feel yourself ready─and only then─come speak to me again."
73,"TEXT_JOBWAR450_01052_POP_MESSAGE","You sense a hostile presence!"
74,"TEXT_JOBWAR450_01052_ACCESS_MESSAGE","The enemy is still about!"
