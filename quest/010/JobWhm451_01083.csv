4,"TEXT_JOBWHM451_01083_SEQ_04","After tracking down the overloaded wain and dispatching a trio of Redbellies, you have successfully recovered the remains of A–Towa–Cant. Return them to Raya–O–Senna at Camp Tranquil."
5,"TEXT_JOBWHM451_01083_SEQ_05","Though relieved at the return of the great mage's remains, Raya–O–Senna has unfortunate news for you. Uprooted from their resting place, the ashes have been drained of their powers, rendering them unsuitable for enchanting your garb. She asks you to continue your training while she consults her brother as to the best course of action.

※The next white mage quest will be available from Raya–O–Senna upon reaching level 50."
