66,"TEXT_JOBWHM300_01079_ARUHNSENNA_000_024","Y-You speak madness, Sister! Surely, you have not forgotten that Padjali tradition strictly forbids sharing the teachings with those not of our kind. The power of white magic is far too great to risk it falling into the wrong hands!"

80,"TEXT_JOBWHM300_01079_RAYAOSENNA_101_037","A most admirable cause, yes? But alas, A–Towa was never to return. He perished in a far–off land, and having taken no apprentices, his legendary powers were lost to us for eternity. Or so I believed...until I met you."
