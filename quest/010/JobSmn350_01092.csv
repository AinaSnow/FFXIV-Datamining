1,"TEXT_JOBSMN350_01092_SEQ_01","You have chosen to perform the Austerities of Earth. Speak with Y'mhitra southwest of Alder Springs in the North Shroud to begin the ritual, and attempt to bind a new egi to your will."
2,"TEXT_JOBSMN350_01092_SEQ_02","After following Y'mhitra's instructions, you summon and defeat the entity known as Titan-Egi. However, before you are able to celebrate, you find yourself under assault by a man who also appears to be a summoner. Though you manage to force the stranger to retreat, you are left bewildered by the unprovoked attack. Speak with Y'mhitra to see how she is faring in the aftermath."
3,"TEXT_JOBSMN350_01092_SEQ_03","You have spoken to Y'mhitra and confirmed that she is sound of body. Return with her to Apkallu Falls in Gridania to discuss the encounter further."
4,"TEXT_JOBSMN350_01092_SEQ_04","Y'mhitra, still somewhat shaken, wonders what could have motivated the haughty stranger's sudden attack. The researcher suggests that you spend some time exploring the capabilities of your new egi ally while she makes use of the Sons' resources to investigate the identity of the murderous summoner.

※The next summoner quest will be available from Y'mhitra upon reaching level 40."
