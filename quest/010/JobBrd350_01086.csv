50,"TEXT_JOBBRD350_01086_JEHANTEL_000_002","That I took an arrow in the knee is what most folk believe...but it is quite clear you are not “most folk.” Very well. I shan't insult your intelligence with an untruth."
51,"TEXT_JOBBRD350_01086_JEHANTEL_000_003","For now, allow me to answer by saying that everything in creation is given to change, and man most of all. I was drawn to the power of song─the power to touch the very souls of men─and decided that I must pursue it."
52,"TEXT_JOBBRD350_01086_JEHANTEL_000_004","Sadly, that power has been all but forgotten in this age of cynicism. Such songs as those performed by tavern bards serve no purpose beyond the amusement of drunkards."
53,"TEXT_JOBBRD350_01086_JEHANTEL_000_005","But that was not always the way of it. There was a time when song could shape the outcome of conflict."
54,"TEXT_JOBBRD350_01086_JEHANTEL_000_006","Ever since nations first quarreled, armies have fielded archers wherewith they rained death upon the enemy from afar. As the battle unfolded, however, the distinction between the lines of friend and foe would grow hazy. Yet the archer's part did not end there."
55,"TEXT_JOBBRD350_01086_JEHANTEL_000_007","He had to stay ever alert, with arrow nocked and eyes trained upon the struggle."
56,"TEXT_JOBBRD350_01086_JEHANTEL_000_008","Even as his comrades fell, turning the earth red with their blood, the archer could ill afford to avert his gaze, lest that moment cost another his life."

58,"TEXT_JOBBRD350_01086_JEHANTEL_000_010","Nerves near to fraying, his breast fit to burst, the archer did the only thing he could: he sang. His bow became a makeshift instrument, plucked as an accompaniment."
59,"TEXT_JOBBRD350_01086_JEHANTEL_000_011","At first, the archer sang only to still the roiling within. But his voice chanced to carry to his comrades. It inspirited those engaged in combat, lending strength to their sword arms. And to those who lay upon the precipice of death, it granted a measure of peace."
60,"TEXT_JOBBRD350_01086_JEHANTEL_000_012","Realizing the tactical potential of song, yet loath to set aside skilled archers for that purpose, armies began raising dedicated regiments of minstrels."

64,"TEXT_JOBBRD350_01086_JEHANTEL_000_016","In eastern La Noscea, spirits are said to haunt the trees of Raincatcher Gully. I would ask you to travel there and await the emergence of these specters."
65,"TEXT_JOBBRD350_01086_JEHANTEL_000_017","Through force of arms you are to release the spirits from their tormented existence and, in the doing, ease their unfathomable suffering. With such a deed might you draw forth an ancient melody from the Soul of the Bard."
