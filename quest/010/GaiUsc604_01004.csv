1,"TEXT_GAIUSC604_01004_SEQ_01","In excited tones, Glaumunt reveals to you his cunning plan for appropriating a magitek reaper. For the first step, seek out an imperial patrol outside Castrum Centri, and alert them to the presence of enemy forces. Remember to greet your superiors with an /imperialsalute."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSC604_01004_SEQ_02","You have alerted the imperial patrol to the enemy's presence. As Glaumunt forewarned, however, the soldiers seem hesitant to venture far beyond the sight of the castrum's walls. You will need to lure them out by using the imperial smoke signal at the specified location."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSC604_01004_SEQ_03","You have succeeded in acquiring a magitek reaper, though some repairs will be required before it can be put to use. Cid bids you meet him back at his workshop in Revenant's Toll. Speak with Slafborn at the front door to be admitted."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSC604_01004_SEQ_04","You arrive at Cid's workshop to find that Biggs and Wedge have already set about repairing the magitek reaper. When their work is complete, it will finally be time to undertake the most dangerous phase of the mission: the rescue itself."
