As the next stage of your training as a white mage, Raya–O–Senna would have you pacify a small tree in the northwest area of Sorrel Haven."
2,"TEXT_JOBWHM350_01080_SEQ_02","You have attuned yourself with the elementals and soothed the tree's anger. Inform Raya–O–Senna of your success."
3,"TEXT_JOBWHM350_01080_SEQ_03","According to Raya–O–Senna, the unrest that has come to the Twelveswood is a manifestation of the elementals' fury. Soothing their anger and restoring harmony to the forest is the duty of the white mage─a duty she feels transcends race or nation. She would ask that you continue to hone your skills while she thinks of a way to persuade her brother, A–Ruhn–Senna, that you are the right <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If> for the job.

※The next white mage quest will be available from Raya–O–Senna upon reaching level 40."

49,"TEXT_JOBWHM350_01080_RAYAOSENNA_000_001","But take heart, for we all must begin somewhere. Today, I would teach you the art of communing with the elementals. This is, by any measure, the very foundation of our art, the means by which we preserve harmony between the forest and our people."

51,"TEXT_JOBWHM350_01080_RAYAOSENNA_000_003","I would ask you to placate this tree. The process is quite simple: stand before the tree and raise your hands. Commune with the elementals that reside within, and attune yourself to them, until your feelings are in absolute harmony."
