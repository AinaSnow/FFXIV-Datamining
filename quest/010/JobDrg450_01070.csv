1,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_SEQ_01","Much to Ser Alberic's surprise, the fugitive Estinien has initiated contact, saying that he has an important matter to discuss with the two of you. Travel to Boulder Downs and await his arrival at the designated rendezvous point."
2,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_SEQ_02","Estinien explains that he did not steal the Eye out of treachery, but rather to spare Ishgard from Nidhogg's wrath when the great wyrm returns. Upon realizing that you have been chosen as a second Azure Dragoon, he proposes that the two of you slay the ancient dragon together. Return to the Observatorium and speak with Ser Alberic for instructions on how to procure the armor necessary for the task."
3,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_SEQ_03","Ser Alberic explains that you must earn your drachen armor as the Azure Dragoons before you did─by trial. Travel to the Ogre's Belly and seek out Ser Brucemont."

9,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_SEQ_09","You have obtained the third piece of the set of drachen armor. Return to the Observatorium and tell Ser Alberic of your success."
10,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_SEQ_10","Ser Alberic informs you that one final trial awaits you. Travel to the graveyard northwest of the Steel Vigil, blow a single note with the flute provided to you, and see to the visitor that arrives."
11,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_SEQ_11","You have slain a mighty dragon of the Dravanian Horde and claimed its skull. Present it to Ser Alberic as proof of your victory."
12,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_SEQ_12","Upon receiving the skull, Ser Alberic offers congratulations and presents you with the fourth piece of drachen armor. Though the fifth piece remains beyond your grasp, the old dragoon assures you of your readiness to complete your training. However, he would ask you to reaffirm your commitment before proceeding. If you are truly prepared to embark with Estinien to do battle with the great wyrm Nidhogg, speak with Ser Alberic once more."

51,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ALBERIC_000_011","Estinien, end this folly at once! You must know that each second the Eye passes outside Ishgard's walls brings us closer to a repeat of the tragedy of twenty summers past. Surrender yourself and the Eye, and return with me to Ishgard before it is too late."
52,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ESTINIEN_000_012","Ah, but it is <Emphasis>already</Emphasis> too late, Master. For you see, Nidhogg has already awakened."

54,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ESTINIEN_000_014","Hear me, Master: you have mistaken the cause of the dragons' return─the Eye is not to blame."
55,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ESTINIEN_000_015","A premonition came to me by virtue of the dragon within, warning me that the great wyrm would soon rouse."
56,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ESTINIEN_000_016","Even as he slumbered, Nidhogg seethed with irrepressible rancor for that wound of twenty years ago. That rancor will send him flying as a speeding arrow to Ishgard, whereupon death and devastation will ensue."
57,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ESTINIEN_000_017","But there is a possible solution: were the Eye taken to a remote land, far from the Holy See─then, and only then, could destruction be averted and the lives of innocent Ishgardians be spared."

60,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ESTINIEN_000_020","Dragons long outlive men and do not soon forget the wrongs done them. What grudge they harbor burns as a fire in their hearts, over time swelling into an unquenchable inferno. You need only look back on history to see that Nidhogg grows stronger with each awakening."
61,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ESTINIEN_000_021","When last he darkened our skies, the great wyrm came within a hair's breadth of laying waste to Ishgard. Naught short of death will prevent him from completing his mission when next he wakes. Nidhogg took everything from me─now I shall take everything from him, even if it means my life."
62,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ESTINIEN_000_022","The Eye works in ways men can ill comprehend, but this much is plain: in choosing two Azure Dragoons in one generation, it means for us to join together in common cause."
63,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ESTINIEN_000_023","Adventurer. You have heard my resolution. Now I ask that you lend me your power─aye, the power of the dragon."

65,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ESTINIEN_000_025","Behold my armor. This is the drachen mail, forged in the lifeblood of dragons. As blood calls to blood, so too does the armor call to the dragon within, redoubling the wearer's strength thereby. If you would realize your potential as an Azure Dragoon, you must needs clad yourself in the same."
66,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ESTINIEN_000_026","Clad so, you will inherit the technique passed from Azure Dragoon to Azure Dragoon down through the generations. Then─and only then─will your training be complete."
67,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ESTINIEN_000_027","But first, you must win the drachen mail as I and Ser Alberic did before you, by proving yourself worthy in the ultimate trial of the Azure─a series of battles so harrowing as to send the unworthy to an early demise."

74,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ALBERIC_000_042","At first, it was my intention to bequeath mine own armor to you. I am an Azure Dragoon no longer, and its powers are wasted on me. It would be simple enough to hand it over to you and complete your training right here and now."
75,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ALBERIC_000_043","But it is as Estinien said: the drachen armor is no ordinary set of mail. Its strength derives from the dragon blood whence it came, the blood's power resonating with the soul of the wearer."
76,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ALBERIC_000_044","Though I can no longer draw upon mine own armor's power, its bond to me was forged years ago. Were I to bestow it on you now, I fear it would offer but a scintilla of the protection it afforded me in those bygone days."
77,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ALBERIC_000_045","Aye, Estinien has the right of it: you must claim your armor as he and I did before you. You must complete the trials of the Azure, that the powers of dragon blood be yours and yours alone."
78,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ALBERIC_000_046","The Ogre's Belly will be where your final test begins. I shall dispatch Ser Brucemont there. Seek him out upon your arrival."

His strength has dwindled since those days, but a dragon past his prime is a formidable foe nonetheless. In slaying him, you have proven yourself worthy of this."
93,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ALBERIC_000_092","You now possess four pieces of the armor that Estinien, myself, and our forebears did wear. While you doubtless wonder about the fifth, I can tell you only that it is not mine to give. Fear not, however─your triumphs in the trials and against a dragon of the Horde give evidence that drachen blood now resonates with yours. Yes, you stand before me as prepared for your ultimate challenge as any could be."
94,"TEXT_JOBDRG450_01070_ALBERIC_000_093","And yet, before we proceed, I would hear it from your own lips. The great wyrm's power is the stuff of legends.
