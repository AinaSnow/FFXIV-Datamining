3,"TEXT_GAIUSC512_01000_SEQ_03","What you found were pieces of Garlean armor plating made of cermet, an alloy unknown to Eorzea─and all but proof against anything she could hurl against it. Report what you learned to Guolgeim."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSC512_01000_SEQ_04","It seems Guolgeim has excellent armor herself, for she is indifferent to the importance of unlocking the secret of the alloy. However, the adventurer is delighted by the prospect of profit, for she is in arrears─and to Wandering Breeze, of all people."
