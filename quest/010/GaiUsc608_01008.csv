51,"TEXT_GAIUSC608_01008_CHANSTELOUP_000_010","The ghost knight? Aye, I saw him. Clad from head to toe in armor that seemed forged from shadow itself, galloping through the Shroud atop his hells-born steed."

One thing I can tell ye, friend─that was no specter or shadow. Nay, he was as solid as you or me."
