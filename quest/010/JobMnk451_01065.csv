2,"TEXT_JOBMNK451_01065_SEQ_02","Widargelt explains to you how the war garb of a monk can strengthen the inner energy of the wearer and aid in opening the chakra. Though they are normally awarded only to those monks who pass prescribed trials, there is a set that was recently stolen. Widargelt is willing to gift these relics to you should you retrieve them. Two have been tracked to southern Thanalan, at the Sepulchre and the Circle of the Tempered, and the third to northern Thanalan, at the abandoned Amajina mythril mine."

8,"TEXT_JOBMNK451_01065_SEQ_08","Erik intends to present his thesis to a conference of his academic peers upon its completion. Continue to travel the path of the monk until that day comes.
