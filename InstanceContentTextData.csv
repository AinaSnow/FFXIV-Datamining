Do what it takes to make the enemy notice ye!"

11300,"As you might have guessed, the purpose of this exercise is to teach cooperation."
11301,"Your ally will hold the enemy's attention─it is your job to take the foe down!"
11302,"味方と協力して、敵を討伐できれば訓練合格だよ！"
11303,"Defeat the axe-wielding training partner!"
11304,"Attack the same foe as your ally to win the battle!"
11305,"That's the way, novice! I'll keep him occupied─you concentrate on bringing him down!"
11306,"Very good!
Now here's a hint about enemy facing!"
11307,"Your opponent will have a harder time avoiding blows from the flanks or from behind."
11308,"There are also certain techniques that perform better when executed from such positions."
11309,"When it comes to your place in a party you are the sharp end of the spear."
11310,"Simply put, your role is to inflict as much damage as possible, while keeping your own skin intact."
11311,"As such, you cannot just attack whichever enemy you please!"
11312,"If you strike a foe other than one controlled by your ally, then you risk becoming the target of deadly aggression."
11313,"Work with your allies to defeat the enemy, and we can move on to the next training exercise."
11400,"For this exercise, you will be fighting multiple opponents!"
11401,"The key to victory is coordination with your comrades─each foe will fall all the swifter under a focused assault!"
11402,"Pay attention, novice!
Target the enemy engaged by your ally!"
11403,"Coordinate with your allies and defeat the enemy!"
11404,"Mark well the opponent your ally has engaged, and attack the same enemy!"
11405,"Start the fight with the staff waver─such foes are often the most dangerous, but the least robust."
11406,"Be sure to attack the same enemy as your ally! Strike the wrong foe five times and you fail this exercise!"
11407,"That's the way, novice! Once this one's down, we'll move on to the fistfighter!"
11408,"There's another yet standing!
Don't lose your focus!"
11409,"He's almost done for!
Grind him into the dust!"
11410,"Work with your allies to defeat the enemy, and we can move on to the next training exercise."
11500,"Do you remember the lesson where I had you evading enemy attacks?"
11501,"This exercise will put that training to the test. You must needs plan your strikes around some fancy footwork!"
11502,"You must pay attention! Watch for the signs whilst you press the attack!"
11503,"Engage the axe wielder, but keep an eye out for counterattacks!"
11504,"Defeat the enemy while avoiding attacks!"
11505,"If you allow yourself to be hit five times, we will start this exercise again from the beginning!"
11506,"Well done! Slippery as an eel, novice!"
11507,"Not bad, aye...
Care to dodge this!?"
11508,"Victory is within reach!
Be on your guard until the very last!"
11509,"Work with your allies to defeat the enemy, and we can move on to the next training exercise."
11600,"This exercise will teach you how to deal with enemy reinforcements."
11601,"As the battle progresses, new foes will appear on the field."
11602,"These sudden arrivals will target your weakest comrade, so you must be quick to eliminate them!"
11603,"Your healer is under attack!
Swiftly now! Eliminate the aggressor! "
11604,"Another enemy has arrived on the field!
Engage this new foe!"
11605,"Keep an eye peeled for reinforcements, novice!"
11606,"Defeat the enemy while staying alert for reinforcements!"
11607,"Excellent!
You handled the situation perfectly!"
11608,"Here comes another!
Make short work of this skirmisher!"
11609,"Very good! Now see the battle to its end!"
11610,"Work with your allies to defeat the enemy, and we can move on to the next training exercise."
11700,"In this exercise, you will learn to manipulate the battlefield."
11701,"During the battle, enemies will pour forth from the rear gate. New foes will continue to flood in whilst this portal remains open."
11702,"You must operate the lever that closes the gate, or your party will be overwhelmed!"
11703,"The reinforcements are without end!
Quickly─use the lever to close the gate!"
11704,"Manipulate the battlefield and defeat the enemy!"
11705,"Engage the enemy, but be wary of the gate!"
11706,"The gate has opened! Ignore the reinforcements for now, and operate the lever!"
11707,"Well done! The flood of enemies has ceased! Now mop up the foes remaining!"
11708,"Work with your allies to defeat the enemy, and we can move on to the next training exercise."
11800,"Now that you understand what is expected of you, we can continue with the lesson."
11801,"The upcoming exercise requires that you keep your ally healed."
11802,"When it comes to your place in a party you are the soothing wind of restoration."
11803,"When you've healed all there is to heal, there may be time to weave in some offensive magicks."
11804,"Heal your ally and defeat the axe-wielding training partner!"
11805,"Your primary concern should be healing your ally!"
11806,"But keep an eye on your companion!
You should not be blasting if someone is bleeding!"
11807,"As such, rather than engaging the enemy directly, your primary role is to focus upon the mending of wounds."
11808,"With the support of your diligent healing, your party will prevail against even the most savage of foes! "
11809,"Provide support, defeat the enemy, and victory will be yours!"
11900,"In this next exercise, you will be healing multiple allies."
11901,"You will need to stay alert, and switch your attention between allies as the situation demands."
11902,"体力の少ない味方がいます！　急いで回復を！"
11903,"There's a new enemy on the field! You'll need to keep an eye on the health of both allies!"
11904,"Maintain the health of your allies and defeat the enemy!"
11905,"Focus your attention on the well-being of your companions!"
11906,"Another enemy threatens your party! You might try attacking this foe if your allies are uninjured."
11907,"Battle is chaotic, and you must needs learn flexibility."
11908,"Thus, you will find yourself in a scenario in which sudden reinforcements threaten your party."
11909,"Provide support, defeat the enemy, and victory will be yours!"
12000,"For this exercise, you will learn to heal whilst avoiding harm."
12001,"As before, you must watch for signs you are being attacked. Move swiftly, and time your casts to avoid interruption."
12002,"If you are hit five times, we shall start again from the beginning!"
12003,"Pay attention, now!
Dead healers cast no cures!"
12004,"Well done! Slippery as an eel, novice!"
12005,"Not bad, aye...
Care to dodge this!?"
12006,"Stand clear of your companions! An attack that targets you need not threaten them as well!"
12007,"Victory is within reach!
Be on your guard until the very last!"
12008,"Defeat the enemy while healing allies and avoiding attacks!"
12009,"Avoid enemy attacks, and heal your allies!"
12010,"Success will be a matter of combining lessons already learned!"
12011,"Provide support, defeat the enemy, and victory will be yours!"
12100,"This is it! The final exercise!"
12101,"As the culmination of yer trainin', all the skills ye've learned'll be put to the test!"
12102,"You've arrived at the mountain's peak─the final exercise!"
12103,"As the culmination of your training, all the skills you've acquired will be put to the test!"
12104,"And now we come to the final exercise..."
12105,"As the culmination of your training, all the skills you've acquired will be put to the test."
12106,"Right, let's start with the basics! Keep the foe away from yer allies, an' watch yer positionin'!"
12107,"Let's begin with the basics, shall we? Pay attention to the enemy's facing, and stay out of harm's way!"
12108,"As always, healing is your primary concern!
Attack only when it is safe to do so!"
12109,"Ye've got more company!
Establish yerself as the biggest threat!"
12110,"Watch out for the jackal!
Put it down quickly!"
12111,"Watch out for the jackal!
Be sure your ally does not fall to its jaws!"
12112,"More reinforcements!
Take control o' the field! Show 'em who's in charge!"
12113,"Another jackal!
Spare your healer its jaws!"
12114,"Another jackal!
Keep an eye on your lightly armored companion!"
12115,"Ye've handled groups in yer previous trainin'! This's no different!"
12116,"Now you face multiple foes! Remember to coordinate efforts with your allies!"
12117,"Now the battle becomes interesting...
You'll need to watch your positioning here."
12118,"Defeat the tamed dodo"
12119,"Defeat the tamed jackals"
12120,"Defeat the tamed puks"
12121,"Defeat the tamed goobbue"
12122,"Yer near the end of it now, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>, but stay focused! This bloke's a bit of a handful..."
12123,"And now for the last challenge!
This one hits hard, so be quick on your feet!"

24243,"Not wholly unexpected, but an exhausting ordeal nevertheless."
24244,"One worthy of she who the Ronkans extolled, must be strong of mind, body, and soul."

24303,"Defeat the antibodies!"
24304,"Defeat Bahamut!"
24305,"This is Bozja Citadel, alright. At least...I think it is. Was everything so distorted when you tested this before?"
24306,"Your recollection of this place appears grossly incomplete. I can but assume your memory is being warped by your subconscious."
24307,"Well I'd rather not stand around laboring over details. Let's look for the transmission tower in the Principia. Anything of import would've been stored there."
24308,"You've done it, Cid! The road has returned."
24309,"We should be able to reach the Principia if we keep heading north."
24310,"Look! There's the transmission tower!"
24311,"The tension in the air is palpable."
24312,"Ah, right. The soldiers were on high alert that day."
24313,"The Bozjan resistance had infiltrated the citadel to stop the Academy's experiments."
24314,"A curious question. One I believe worth investigating. Shall we?"
24315,"The memory appears to be...mending itself? Interesting."
24316,"Could they be a manifestation of your subconscious? If so, they likely seek to suppress your memories of the citadel."
24317,"Meaning they intend to purge us from your mind. We cannot let them!"
24318,"Is there no end to them? We have to hold on, lest they succeed in erasing us from Cid's mind."
24319,"Are we sure I'm not suffering from a sudden onset of psychosis?"
24320,"Just a little further..."
24321,"Is that...Cid? Do you recall this happening?"
24322,"Father, please! If you would just look over this data─"
24323,"Enough, damn you! The next time you question me it shall be the last. Now leave!"
24324,"You of all people should understand the risks. Why do you refuse to see reason?"
24325,"It's rather unlike him to overlook data, no matter the source."
24326,"Look here. You─er, I mean... He left behind his research documentation."
24327,"There they are! The replicas of Gunnhildr's blades!"
24328,"Bahamut!? This has to be another attempt by your subconscious to stop us. Please, Cid, you have to pull yourself together."
24329,"Careful. I like not the looks of this..."
24330,"Oh no! Could his psyche be deteriorating? <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, look out!"
24331,"We have to hold on! For Cid!"
24332,"Thank you. I... I feel better, now."
24333,"Perhaps now your subconscious will be more forthcoming with the truth in this memory."
24334,"The Meteor project cannot be stopped! I will not allow it!"
24335,"Taste my steel!"
24336,"Careful of his blade!"
24337,"Your struggles shall avail you not!"
24338,"Keep your distance!"
24339,"You would dash yourself against my shield? Very well..."
24340,"I will mount your heads upon my wall!"

24347,"<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. A little help, if you'd be so kind."
24348,"I can take the brunt of it, but I'll need a little help!"
24349,"By thy leave!"
24350,"Now! Drive it back!"
24351,"Hold on just a little longer!"

24356,"It is time I bring my full strength to bear!"
24357,"All of our research, our planning... It cannot be for naught!"
24358,"The Empire cannot...must...not..."
24359,"Leave this to me."
24360,"Quickly! My barrier shan't hold long!"
24361,"We've come too far to fail now!"
24362,"Come on, we can't give up!"
24363,"Hold on, Thancred!"
24364,"We're so close!"
24365,"We've no choice but to fight. Otherwise, his subconscious will continue to repress this memory."
24366,"What in the world? The road, it just...ends."
24367,"A consequence of your incomplete memories. You have to think back, Cid. Where did this road lead?"
24368,"Damn it all, the road is cut off again. Come on, Cid, you have to remember."
24369,"A psychological stimulus to prompt recollection... Yes, that just might work."
24370,"Well done, Cid. Let us press onward."
24371,"Search for clues to help Cid's memory."
24372,"Speak with Cid."
24373,"Did you see that? A military base appeared out of thin air... Or out of my mind, I suppose."
24374,"Do you suppose it's possible we can tamper with this memory?"
24375,"Altering memories is easier said than done, it seems. Well, let's keep going."
24376,"Here we are. The Principia. Inside is the transmission tower."
24377,"What in the seven hells are these!?"
24378,"Curious that we could defeat these but not the soldiers earlier. Perhaps because they are not truly part of this memory?"
24379,"We can worry about that later. Come on, we're nearly to the tower."
24380,"Gah! I... I can't...move."
24381,"It seems to be having an adverse effect on Cid's psyche. Quickly, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, we have to stop it!"

24388,"So many sleepless nights spent on those damned papers. All for nothing..."
24389,"If my suspicions are correct, then he was already... Ahem. Never mind, let us press on. The truth awaits us."

25205,"First, I want you to try attacking the guidance system. Don't worry, it won't fight back!"
25206,"The G-Warrior is armed with a range of weaponry. Now's your chance to learn what it's capable of."

Now, try activating the Pyretic Booster!"
25214,"You'll notice that your movement speed is much improved. But as shown on your monitor, the G-Warrior becomes more and more structurally unstable as time passes."

25220,"We've covered offense, now to look at defense. This is where the Aetherial Aegis should come in handy."
25221,"Unfortunately, you can't keep the barrier up indefinitely as it will drain the G-Warrior's power reserves. You might even run out of energy for the weapons, so watch out."
25222,"First, let's try deploying the Aetherial Aegis."
25223,"The monitor shows how much power is being drained. Don't let it get too low!"

25226,"Unlike before, there is no way to escape its attacks, so you'll need to weather them using the barrier."
25227,"You're a natural! All right, that's everything. Time to end the simulation."
25228,"You'll need to deactivate the Aetherial Aegis before you run out of power!"
