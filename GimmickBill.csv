Toto–Rak Expedition Notes  (Day 1)
Strange lights sighted from just inside dungeon entrance. Creatures of the forest? Closer inspection reveals them to be man-made machines. Ashcrown Consortium technologist accompanying party believes them to be of Garlean design. Labels them “magitek photocells.” Collect for further study."
3,"First Spear Rydel
Toto–Rak Expedition Notes  (Day 2)
Dramatic increase in light emitted by photocells observed upon collecting fourth. Dispatched two lancers to Gridania with orders to deliver the photocells to Stillglade Fane. Soon after their departure, received linkpearl transmission from pair reporting marked reduction in photocell glow as distance from Maws increased. Recalled lancers."
4,"First Spear Rydel
Toto–Rak Expedition Notes  (Day 3)
Lancer downed attempting to breach what Ashcrown technologist calls a “magitek field.” Technologist advises that there should be a device in the vicinity powering the barrier. No choice but to look for it. Divided party into four teams to expedite search. Whisperings of discontent? No. Just my imagination."
5,"First Spear Rydel
Toto–Rak Expedition Notes  (Day 4)
Device located, but one team yet to return. Barrier terminal unresponsive until technologist suggests applying set of four photocells. How does he know these things? Watch him. Lancer suggests locating missing team. Decide to press on."
6,"First Spear Rydel
Toto–Rak Expedition Notes  (Day 5)
Encountered sheer drop several yalms down passage. Rock face looks treacherous but descent should be possible with ropes. Return climb may be troublesome─especially with the technologist slowing us down. Lancers seem uncertain. After consulting with second officer, have decided to proceed. Will send scouts to find alternate route back to entrance."
7,"First Spear Rydel
Toto–Rak Expedition Notes  (Day 6)
Discovered mangled bodies of the missing team beyond the drop. Have lost linkpearl contact with the two scouts sent to find alternate route out. Presumed lost or deserted. Will continue expedition for now, but must consider retreat if situation worsens."
8,"First Spear Rydel
Toto–Rak Expedition Notes  (Day 7)
Three lancers report difficulty breathing, as if something dank and heavy is clogging their lungs. Another two disappeared into the darkness, screaming. Technologist believes cause to be extreme levels of aetheric energy detected ahead. Lies. He has done something to us! The elementals warned me about him. Should have listened. Technologist suggests turning back. I see him for what he is now. Garlean worm is dead. Feel better. Pressing on."

12,"I finally mustered the courage to speak with your hero, my love. <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> is as kind and wise as <If(PlayerParameter(4))>she<Else/>he</If> is brave and strong. <If(PlayerParameter(4))>She<Else/>He</If> listened attentively as I told <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If> all about you─about us.

Though <If(PlayerParameter(4))>she<Else/>he</If> is a <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If> of few words, or perhaps because <If(PlayerParameter(4))>she<Else/>he</If> is, everything <If(PlayerParameter(4))>she<Else/>he</If> said seemed to inspire me. Why, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> gaze alone instilled me with a confidence I never knew I had. Truly, I feel better prepared to face the future for having met <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If>. How right you were, my love."
13,"Scarcely a week has passed since we returned to the village, and already I cannot help thinking it was a mistake. There was a time when this place seemed just large enough. But having seen the wider world, it all feels so insufferably confined that I often find myself struggling for breath. I know that it is the same for you, my love.



The only time I feel truly alive is when I am adventuring with you. We are as caged birds in this backwater. So long as we remain here, we will never spread our wings and soar. So let us take to the road, and create a lifetime of wonderful memories together."
14,"I could not have hoped for a more romantic first visit to Mor Dhona. The crystals that pierce the landscape glowed in all their majesty, as if to celebrate our future together. And as we lazed by Silvertear Lake, watching the waves lapping at the shore, the sun took its leave behind the horizon, that we might enjoy a moment of intimacy.



“I want us to be together forever.” You first said these words to me years ago, and you said them to me again tonight. I am so happy to be with you."
15,"You have been looking deathly pale of late. The scorching heat of Thanalan does not agree with you. You were never fond of hot climes, and it was a mistake to come here. Let us make for Coerthas, where the bracing air will put roses on your cheeks."
16,"I know, I know─it is not easy being without a body. I promise to find one for you, but you must have patience. You are my husband–to–be, and there is nothing I would not do for you, so please, have faith in me. Give me time, my love, and I shall make you whole again, as you make me."
17,"I am sorry to keep you waiting, my love, but we cannot afford to compromise─not where your new body is concerned. Ordinary adventurers die often enough, leaving their ordinary corpses, but if you are to be like <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, we cannot settle for anything less than extraordinary.
But a strong body requires an equally strong soul─as I recently discovered. Now, you are probably worried that strong souls are rare, and so they are─but never fear, for we can create one ourselves! All we need is a plentiful supply of the weaker kind, and they are common indeed. Be patient just a little longer, my love, and all will be as you desire."
18,"With the nigh-endless supply of bodies here, I will make you well again, my love. Then we shall be wed as man and wife, and forever be joined as the gods intended. Of course, it is only fitting that a proper ceremony be held, with guests in attendance. I will send out invitations to all our friends. They will be so happy for us, I have no doubt they will jump at the chance to part with their souls."
19,"To whoever reads this─if there is anyone left to read it─let it be known that I, Ser Pascaleret Neurtaille, bore witness to Dalamud's fall. The lesser moon's descent, the black doom which emerged from within, the flames which spread across the horizon, turning night to day─it shall haunt me for the rest of my days.
It is the dawn of the “Seventh Umbral Era,” according to some of the men. I told them to put no stock in the ravings of the prophetess, but even I do not know what to believe anymore."
20,"The engineers are still surveying the damage, but anyone with eyes can tell that the Dusk Vigil is beyond repair. Some walls are hardly fit to be called as such, piles of crumbling masonry as they are.

The officers have been pleading with Ser Yuhelmeric, asking him to order a withdrawal. He knows our position is untenable, yet he refuses. “We will hold it to the last, for we are the shields on the wall─the defenders of the Holy See,” he says. He is a brave, pious man. Less so, we who serve under him."
21,"The men we rescued from the collapsed wing have not fared well. Given our dwindling supplies and this seemingly endless blizzard, we may be forced to make difficult decisions soon.

This unseasonable weather grows worse with every passing day, and the toll it has taken on morale is plain. We have yet to receive reinforcements from the Holy See, and I fear none shall come. Nevertheless, Ser Yuhelmeric remains steadfast in his decision and will suffer no talk of withdrawal.
Ser Yuhelmeric's steward tells me he passes hours in the chapel, praying to the Fury for guidance... But I chanced to see him once, as he knelt before the statue. His eyes were transfixed upon the jewel in its helm, and he was whispering things I dare not write."
22,"Ser Yuhelmeric has taken me into his confidence. He says I am an honest man. I wish I were a braver one.


The mutiny has been quelled. Among the starving, half-mad knights were Ser Yuhelmeric's most trusted officers. He wielded the axe himself.


Ser Yuhelmeric received me in the chapel afterwards. I told him we will not last a fortnight without food. He smiled and told me that the Fury has blessed us with a bounty of fresh meat, then returned to his prayers. I joined him."
23,"O Halone, pray forgive Your humble servant. For too long have I let fear rule my heart, and in my cowardice have I been party to unspeakable acts.


I know now I shall never see my children again─nor would I want them to look upon their father's face...and what it has become.


I am outside Her grace."

31,"The rise of the Garlean Empire in the Year 1522 of the Sixth Astral Era led to significant changes in the structure of Garlean society. This is most evident in the adoption of titles which serve to indicate an individual's place within the social hierarchy.
The following information was compiled with the aid of informants within the Empire and has yet to be verified:
Royalty: Zos - The emperor; Yae - Member of the royal family in the line of succession; Wir - Member of the royal family with no claim to the throne.
Military: Van - Legatus; Tol - Tribunus laticlavius; Sas - Tribunus angusticlavius or Praefectus castrorum; Rem - Primus pilus or Pilus prior; Quo - Primi ordines or Centurion; Pyr - Optio, Tesserarius, or Decurion; Oen - Duplicarius or Legionarius.
Specialists: Nan - Chief engineer or engineer; Mal - Primus medicus or senior magitek technician; Lux - Chief medicus or magitek technician; Kir - Senior medicus or senior technician; Jen - Medicus or technician."
32,"Public Officials: Iyl - Dictator or Princeps senatus; Het - Consul, Praetor, Tribunus plebis, Aedilis, or Quaestor; Goe - Censor; Fae - Unknown; Eir - Unknown; Dus - Lictor.

This hierarchy extends to the general populace as well, though it is far less complex. The majority of citizens bear the “Bas” title, and there is a smaller group which appears to be comprised of respected artisans who have adopted the “Cen” title.
The “Aan” title is bestowed upon the peoples of annexed territories and indicates that they lack even the most basic rights afforded to a citizen.
However, many Garleans view this as an opportunity rather than a condemnation, as citizenship may be granted to those who have demonstrated exceptional skills, as well as those who have contributed twenty or more years of military service."

34,"Though there is some debate as to whether or not Merlwyb Bloefhiswyn and her League of Lost Bastards were the first Eorzeans to discover the western continent, there is no denying that their navigational charts were instrumental in establishing the major trade routes of today.
Moreover, the accounts from their expedition are widely regarded as both informative and entertaining. Of particular note is their first encounter with the Mamool Ja, as well as other indigenous peoples and creatures which seemed curiously intent on their demise.
These travel journals have since inspired a legion of explorers and treasure hunters to retrace the League's journey. Yet in spite of their numbers, the existence of “a bleedin' city o' gold” remains unconfirmed..."
35,"Beauty is ephemeral, but it needn't be. My lady Amandine knows this well, lovely creature that she is. Would that I could have the genuine article in my keeping...but alas, I shall have to settle for a pale imitation.

The vessel is not quite up to my usual standards, but beggars can't be choosers, as they say. I washed and anointed it per the instructions, then secured it to the bed with chains─wouldn't want her to get ideas above her station, oh no!
Gods, just the thought of it is enough to get my blood pumping! I can hardly wait to welcome my beloved succubus into this world!"
36,"The tentacles...so many tentacles! And the sound of it writhing on the bed! Gods, just listening to it is agony!

41,"Our lives are as fleeting as a dream. What a somber thought."
42,"Once upon a time, there lived a free-spirited boy who loved to play in the forest with his pet chocobo. But the forests were fraught with peril, and one day, a band of brigands ambushed the boy, spiriting him away to the harsh mountains of the north.
Yet there be dragons there, and as they rode up the mountain path, one of those majestic beasts came swooping down from the heavens. The boy's chocobo reared in fright, sending the boy tumbling down the mountainside to his nigh-certain demise.
And yet the gods saw fit to spare his life, if only meagerly so. As he lay there, battered and broken, all manner of foul beasts drew near, threatening to rip him limb from limb. Just as the boy was making his peace with the Twelve, another dragon appeared. A smaller creature, yes, but even a small dragon is a fearsome opponent indeed.
It was then that the strangest thing happened. With a mighty roar, the dragon turned upon the circling beasts and spit forth a burst of flames that reduced them to so much ash, saving the poor boy's life. With what half seemed a smile, the dragon approached the wounded child and gently raised him up to sit upon his back, and the two flew off to the gods know where."
43,"Oh, but why must the gods curse me so! By what cruel trick of fate was I given this oversized, ungainly body and sent into this world where <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> abide─my princess, my goddess, my everything!
Your delicate hands, your shapely head, your dark eyes in which I would lose myself and never return! Yes, every aspect of your being strikes me to depths of the heart I knew not I had until the day you first appeared before me.
And yet, I am a Roegadyn. Could one of your kind ever love a lumbering brute such as me?
Good sense tells me that the answer is no, but my heart─nay, my very <Emphasis>soul</Emphasis> will not accept it! For bereft of your company, I fear I will wither away into a wretched husk of what was once a man.
O, have mercy on this poor soul, my goddess! Pray grace me with your presence when next your travels call you to Limsa.
My beloved Brayflox, just say the word and I am yours forever!"
44,"It is widely known that the Mamool Ja boast one of the most impressive indigenous societies to be found in the New World. It would be a mistake, however, to view the Mamool Ja as a single, uniform people.
A careful analysis of documents brought back by explorers reveals that the Mamool Ja are more accurately described as a federation or alliance of numerous distantly related tribes, each with distinguishing physical characteristics: the brown-scaled Hoobigo with their distinctively long combs, the large-eyed, blue-scaled Boonewa, and the mottled Doppro.
It is further said that although Mamool Ja rarely marry outside their own tribes, such unions do occur on the occasion of certain religious observances, and are known to produce two-headed offspring that are hailed as “blessed siblings” and groomed to be warlords from a young age. Indeed, the Autarch, ruler of all Mamool Ja kind, is known to be one of them..."
45,"“From mutton to morel, oyster to orobon, eel to eft—Eorzea does not want for delicious and delightful ingredients to stimulate the senses of any culinarian. And yet how is it that we came to know that the flesh of these creatures would pleasure our palate so? The answer is self-evident: for every familiar ingredient, someone, at some point in our history, first took it upon him or herself to eat it!
And yet this answer raises another question: what wondrous flavors and textures remain undiscovered, just waiting for a brave soul to discover them? And so it was that I took it upon myself to investigate the culinary suitability of coblynflesh! Why coblyns, you ask? To which I say, good reader, why <Emphasis>not</Emphasis> coblyns!”
The above passage was composed by my elder brother. Sadly, they were the last words he ever wrote, for—as he soon discovered—coblyn feelers are poisonous. Armed with this knowledge and vowing that his sacrifice would not go to waste, I resolved to carry on his life's work..."
46,"Proceedings of the 284th Convocation of the Amdapori Council of Magi

A Vote was called to settle on a Name for a potent and newly fashioned Healing-Spell.
Being that said Healing-Spell was an Augmentation of Curaga, erst the most potent Healing-Spell, the following Names were proposed by the Council.

Curago, Curaza, Curaja, Curagura

Finding the afore-written Names duly lacking in Gravity and the existing Hierarchy of Spell-Names needlessly abstruse, the Council did Vote by a margin of Seventeen to Three to do away with existing Naming-Conventions entirely and adopt a new system of numerical Spell-Names, as writ below, to be used henceforth.

Cure I, Cure II, Cure III, Cure IV

It is recorded."
47,"Many scholars believe that the popular children's tale of the Boy and the Dragon Gay is, in fact, an adaptation of an older Ishgardian myth, one telling of which is transcribed below for the reader's reference.

In a bleak village on the outskirts of Coerthas there lived a shepherd boy, poor but kind of heart. One day a band of ruffians came and spirited the boy away, seeking to deliver him to a slave trader in hopes of earning some coin.
No sooner had they left the village than they were set upon by a great dragon. Down from the heavens it swooped, tearing the blackguards limb from limb and charring their carcasses with hellsfire.
But it was by no mere chance that the great wyrm had found them, no! The boy had befriended the great wyrm some time ago, and it had sensed the danger to its dear friend.
Alas, in the chaos, the boy had tumbled from the mountains, and lay half-dying at the base of the cliff. Seeing its dear friend lying there, battered and beaten, the dragon gave unto the child of its blood. So it was that the boy took to the skies as the wyrm's minion, flying off to only the gods know where..."
48,"Using the crude wooden spoon I was provided, I sip at the thin broth, wondering if it is lentils I taste. It is, of course. Lentil soup is all that I have eaten since arriving in this village more than a month ago (soup being a generous term for the pathetic puddle trying its best to cover the bottom of my equally crude bowl). Would that my hosts had even salt to flavor the lukewarm fare, but war erased any hope of trade caravans making it this far...not that these forsaken villagers have aught to trade. Soon their lot will succumb to hunger, and the desert will reclaim them and any memory of their existence. Such is life in times of peril."

52,"Lo, seeker in days unborn, god-blade bearer. Know you: this tower challenges the sky. Ware the watcher, the ward of the Three Waits, soul-hungry, unsated."
53,"Multiples of three? 3, 6, 9, 12. Multiples of four? 4, 8, 12. A concept so simple a child─let alone the architect of the city's defense network─could grasp it. Or so one would think!"
54,"A wise arithmetician once said the primes were the most lonesome of numbers. To that I say bollocks! 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31...and on to eternity. There are enough digits here to start a fellowship!"
55,"We have taken into our safekeeping twin spears of Eureka’s forging─Orlasrach, the black, and Munderg, the white. Though physically separate, the weapons are aetherially linked, and are a single entity in all but form."
56,"When brought together, the power of one amplifies that of the other, and even should they be isolated, if one comes under threat, its counterpart will immediately teleport to its aid."
57,"Fortunately, this defensive mechanism can be defeated. They do not teleport when attacked simultaneously, and thus is it possible to prevent their reunion."
58,"It cannot be stressed enough that these spears are a single entity. So long as one persists, the other will regenerate and return from apparent destruction. If they are to be eliminated permanently, they must be struck down at the exact same moment."

62,"This hall of learning was established in honor of the first Mitron, a scholar renowned for his exceptional contributions to our marine biosphere. It is here that many ichthyologists seek to follow in Mitron's footsteps, and engender sea creatures characterized by traits both unique and beneficial.
“Diversity is the key to a robust star. The ocean is the soup of life, and we must endeavor to enhance its richness.” 
Such were the words of Mitron, and they guide our research to this day."
63,"Did you know that the original Halmarut, a man lauded for countless advancements in the field of phytobiology, was an avid landscape gardener? He was famed for botanical labyrinths of intricate design, the foliage of which he sought to protect from voracious pests with the inventive application of creation magicks─a recreational project said to have led to the evolution of the world's first carnivorous plants. 
Students of his research later expanded upon those early techniques, and successfully developed an extended family of ambulatory flora. If you, too, wish to set down roots in this fertile field of study, hearken you to the Words of Halmarut and submit your application to the Akadaemia."
64,"The instances of spontaneous creation occurring in the lands across the ocean are now a confirmed phenomenon. Seemingly unguided by conscious will, these aberrations are said to manifest as malformed “beasts” of nightmarish aspect and unrestrained ferocity. 
High-ranking phantomologists have since been dispatched to afflicted areas, where they conducted the capture and transport of a single entity. This specimen, characterized by a disproportionately large maw, was dubbed “Archaeotania,” and investigations into its aetheric composition are ongoing. 
A theory posited by the esteemed Lahabrea suggests that the shape these fiendish beings assume is not random, but rather an amalgamation of the fears which lurk beneath our rational minds. As of this writing, researchers have begun pursuing methods by which potent guardians of deliberate design might be engendered to stand against this mounting threat."
