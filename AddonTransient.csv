<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>Arcana Stones<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
  You and your opponent each have three of these immobile crystals on
  the playing field. Shatter all of your enemy's Arcana Stones to claim
  victory.
<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>Gates<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
  Minions will appear in front of your currently selected gate.
  Returning minions to a gate area will restore their HP.
  Minions can still be summoned from a destroyed gate, but they will be
  unable to exit the gate area. Conversely, minions outside a destroyed
  gate will be unable to enter.
<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>Search Eye<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
  This structure reveals your opponent's minions. If the Search Eye is
  destroyed, you will only be able to see enemy units that are near
  your own minions.
<UIForeground>F201FA</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201FB</UIGlow>Shield<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
  This structure adds defensive strength to Arcana Stones. Destroy the
  enemy Shield and your opponent's Arcana Stones will be more easily
  shattered.

<UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Structural Regeneration<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
  All structures except for Arcana Stones can only be temporarily
  destroyed. Their various functions will reactivate at full strength
  after a certain amount of time has passed.
  ※Positioning your minions near a destroyed structure will hasten
  　the reactivation process.

<UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Play to Your Minions' Strengths<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
  Each variety of minion is capable of inflicting greater damage against
  certain structures. Learn each unit's strengths, and pick the right
  minion for the job!

<UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Turn the Tide with Special Actions<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
  These conditions must be met before a special action can be used:
  ・Four minions of the same variety are gathered in an action party
  ・Each minion in the action party has full action points
   (Action points accumulate over time)
  To perform a special action, select an individual minion from the
  action party, and press the Execute Action button on the minion
  hotbar.

<UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Mastering Traps<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>
  Some minions will place traps with their special actions. A trap will
  become armed ten seconds after it has been placed, and it can then
  be triggered by pressing the Trigger Trap button on the minion
  hotbar.
  ※Only one trap can be placed at a time.

1003,"Fellowships"
1004,"Fellowships are gatherings of players who share common interests. With up to 1,000 members permitted in each fellowship, they provide an excellent way to connect and socialize with like-minded adventurers.

Anyone can create their own fellowship or become a member of another. Fellowships are cross-world, and you can belong to a maximum of ten at any given time.

To search for fellowships that are currently recruiting, select <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Social<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground> from the <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>main menu<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>, and then <UIForeground>F201F4</UIForeground><UIGlow>F201F5</UIGlow>Fellowship Finder<UIGlow>01</UIGlow><UIForeground>01</UIForeground>.

Each fellowship is led by a master, who can grant administrative rights to other members to assist them. The master role automatically falls to the fellowship's founder, but it can also be transferred to another.

Join a fellowship or create your own, and gain access to its myriad benefits!"
