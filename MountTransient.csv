1,"Summon your Grand Company-issued battle chocobo.","Born and bred in the city–state of Ishgard, the majority of company chocobos are geldings of the rouncey variety; however, massive destriers and miniature Belah'dian jennets are also raised to accommodate the builds of Roegadyn and
Lalafellin riders respectively.","Chocobos are stout-

4,"Use the odd-shaped horn gifted to you by the wandering minstrel to call a massive goobbue to your side.","Traded for a song by the High Satrap of a distant land, the secret to taming these creatures once thought to be unbreakable was introduced to Eorzea by a mysterious wandering minstrel who journeyed through the realm in the final
days before the Calamity.","Would that I had the
girth of a goobbue!
  - Nanamo Ul Namo"
5,"Five years and a realm-shaking Calamity were not enough to break the bonds between you and your loyal steed. A single whistle and he will be at your side once again.","In the five years following your sudden disappearance from the Carteneau Flats, your ever-faithful chocobo spent each waking moment galloping across the realm in search of his lost master. His myriad adventures are nothing less than fantastical
and heartbreaking...but that is
a story for another day.","Go find the chocobo you
rode in on, and ride on out.

6,"Call into battle your suit of Garlond Ironworks-modified magitek armor.","This suit of Garlean-developed reaper-class magitek battle armor has had its original control systems purged and replaced with a new, modified core built by Cid of the Garlond Ironworks.","At last, our very own
suit of magitek armor!
  - Cid Garlond"

8,"Summon your fleet-footed battle coeurl, trained from a pup to recognize you as a friend...not food.","Native to the jungles of the Near East, coeurls were only recently introduced to Eorzea, brought over from faraway lands such as Thavnair by Ul'dahn nobles who thought to breed them as pets. Now, but a handful of skilled tamers living in recluse on the Pearl are
said to be able to train them.","Hey, good lookin'!
Catch my coeurl yet?

9,"Summon forth a riding ahriman, bound to this realm with powerful magicks guaranteed to never fade.","Though little is known of the void and the creatures which call the extra-dimensional realm home, scholars have discovered that there is a strict hierarchy amongst voidsent consisting of twelve distinct tiers. Ahrimans are believed to fall into the fifth, making them formidable foes...

she kept the beasts, eventually
training them to serve as mounts.","Do not presume to
provoke the behemoth to
battle. You will die.

19,"Summon your cavalry drake, trained by the drake whisperer of the Brotherhood of Ash.","Training a cavalry drake is a long and arduous process that begins the moment the scalekin hatches. Never allowed to see its mother, the creature is raised solely in the presence of a drake whisperer while being weaned on the incendiary glands of aged battle
drakes to ensure it is both
submissive and deadly.","You are as a lost kitten

a magnificent laurel with
which to hide his scars.","Naught is as exhilarating
as a romp through the
forest on goobbueback.

21,"Call into battle your gilded suit of magitek armor. Its golden coating serves to resist magicks while impressing members of the opposite sex.","It only took a few heated skirmishes with the allied city–states for Garlemald to realize that the magicks wielded by the realm's mages were too much for even the thickest of magitek armor plating. Alloyed gilding has since been discovered to dampen the
effects of elemental charges

the fat chocobo down.","Huff...huff...heave...heave...
  - Fat Chocobo"
26,"Summon your cavalry elbst, raised from an egg by Pahh of Novv's Clutch.","To ensure his elbst do not find themselves at a disadvantage to swift-running chocobos, Pahh of Novv's Clutch clips the webbing on their feet at a young age, rendering them more capable of achieving high speeds on land─though they will ever be slower than their brethren
while underwater.","My elbst is your elbst.

27,"Summon forth a bevy of bombs who will bear you in comfort upon a hovering palanquin.","Upon learning that his creations were forever lacking the power to combust, 789th Order Acolyte Ba Go did what any master of explosives would─attach the bombs to the corners of an iron bench and create a floating coach.","Hack and slash and

reverted back to a feral state.","I, too, see the friends

  - Gregory"
33,"Summon forth your fearless warbear, veteran of a thousand battles, to fill your enemies with dread.","In generations past, warriors seeking fame and glory would journey out into the untamed wilds of Abalathia's Spine in search of the giant grizzled bears that roamed the mountains, and would wrestle the beasts into submission, riding their prizes back to civilization. That is, or die trying.","How do you like my
pets? Not too playful

  - Beast Trainer"
34,"Summon forth your draught chocobo, a massive bird large and strong enough to bear two riders.","This heretofore unseen breed of chocobo was said to have been discovered by chocobo hunters searching for the legendary Chocobo Forest. Its enormous size would make it a fine pack chocobo, but its foul temper prevents it from completing even the simplest of tasks without the injury
of some poor rider.","The thing was thrice my

maimed several keeps.
  - Battlewarden Ribald"
35,"Summon forth your deadly direwolf, one of five pups found huddling together in the snow near the corpse of their slain mother.","Mass cullings of the beasts during the Sixth Astral Era prompted naturalists to deem the species extinct.

41,"Summon forth your ceremony chocobo, large enough to bear both you and your special someone.","Raised by Ishgard's master breeders for beauty and purity of stock, its snow white feathers are natural and, though fully developed, as soft as down.

who will allow dual
riders upon its back.","Don't stand on ceremony,

42,"Summon forth Sleipnir─undying steed of the elder primal Odin. His coat is as dark as void, while his eyes glow a sanguine red.","Blessed by the elder primal himself, Sleipnir will forever remain loyal to those who have proven themselves worthy. In addition to being fearless in battle, the dark steed is also able to manipulate his corporeal form to
accommodate any
rider, large or small.","If it hadn't been

  - Uma Bugyo"
44,"Summon forth your parade chocobo who, by the looks of him, has not marched in many parades.","Originally purchased by the Adventurers' Guild for use in festival parades, this portly steed quickly wore out his welcome by devouring a moon's worth of fodder in a single turn of the sun. Unable to pay the price of upkeep, the guild
passed the reigns to some-
one more “commendable.”"," I'll be at the parade with
whomever else I can drag along.
  - Botulf"
45,"Summon de forth your black de chocobo. ","A purebred Ishgardian black chocobo, trained from birth by House Fortemps knight, Ser Haurchefant, and presented to you in a gesture of true friendship. The bird is slightly more muscular than you expected and exhibits the strange
habit of squatting
when left to itself.","Black chocobos are all well and
good, but the true reward is the
exoneration of your comrades.

However, through the efforts of both Ul'dahn zoologists and thaumaturges, a handful have been successfully trained not only to accept riders, but also wield ancient magicks which allow the colossal scalekin to fly.","M-Me? Perfectly fine!
S-Solid as an adamantoise!
  - Cocobezi"
47,"Summon forth Kirin, Far Eastern king of the beasts.","Ask any man in Othard who rules the realm of beasts, and you will receive the same answer─Kirin. It is believed that the lion-like creature has walked the eastern lands for over a thousand years and
will only answer the
call of a hero it has

transportation device.","Her report also mentions a
violent encounter with a

49,"Summon forth a purebred Abalathian hoarhound named after its pack's legendary leader.","Following the rise of Ishgard, hoarhounds all but disappeared from the Coerthas highlands.

   - Aymeric"
56,"Summon forth your war panther─a silent killer trained to maim anyone and everything...excepting you, of course.","While more difficult to train than their cousins the coeurls, panthers bring their riders much more advantage on the field due to the beasts' inherent affinity to various magic. It is also believed that many dark knight battle techniques

watching panthers hunt.","I have seen you

   - Mayaru Moyaru"
181,"Summon Kamuy of the Nine Tails, legendary auspice, completely independent from Kyubi of the Nine Tails.","Only an individual who has proven his worth by taming no less than seven kamuy might summon this fabled vulpine auspice from her burrow in the heavens. Despite obvious similarities to the <Emphasis>other</Emphasis> vulpine auspice, Kyubi of the Nine Tails, this ageless vixen has her own storied history...which is, sadly, too long to list here.","Most revered among the
kamuy, Kyubi is come!
   - The Wandering Minstrel"
182,"Summon your hallowed kamuy, noble wolf blessed by the azure auspice Seiryu.","Abandoned by its master, this loyal canine was discovered by the auspice Seiryu and granted a new life in service of the thousand-year-old lord.","A wolf! Or at least someone
what's got big ears and a long
fluffy tail!
   - Nashu Mhakaracca"
183,"Summon forth your war tiger to tear the enemy's morale to shreds with its cruel, curved fangs.","Even among tigers, the sabertooth is said to be notoriously difficult to tame, but those creatures raised from birth may come to bear riders upon their backs and into war.","T-T-T-T-T-TIGERS!!!
- Hapless Namazu"
184,"Summon your Eurekan petrel, because who hasn't dreamed of gazing down upon all creation from the mantle of a wind-borne gastropod?","Of all the species of petrels known to man, the Eurekan petrel is the only one which is not actually a petrel, but, in fact, an oversized carnivorous sea slug. Admittedly, unlike most sea slugs, this unique variety possesses the capacity for extended flight, hence the understandable misnomer.","I know you love me,
little swallow, but sometimes
you just have to let go!
   - Karasu"
185,"Call into battle your magitek avenger A-1─outfitted and optimized for alpine warfare.","Proving once again there is naught a Garlean engineer can do that a goblin cannot do better, this magitek avenger, nicknamed the “Yeti,” has been repurposed with several layers of self-insulating exoplating, which draw on the ceruleum engine's residual heat to keep the rider warm even in the coldest of climes.","I'll avenge myself, kupo!
   - Pukla Puki"
186,"Call into battle Demi-Ozma─the round mound of spellbound.","After concluding that Ozma of the Weeping City was but a preliminary attempt to weave an aether-based simulacrum of the Eurekan phenomenon Proto Ozma, the Students of Baldesion endeavored to apply similar magicks in the creation of what they dubbed “Demi-Ozma,” hoping to learn what makes the entity tick.","Follow the sphere!
   - X'rhun Tia"
187,"Summon forth your amaro, Norvrandt's favorite beast of burden.","Of all the mounts seen in Norvrandt, naught is more ubiquitous than the amaro. Originally created by the mages of ancient Ronka, who selectively bred the flightless cama, present-day beasts carry the seed of their ancestors, which may
manifest in the form of
superior intellect.","That ever-so-endearing “gwee!”
It's enough to melt a man's heart,
I tell you.
   - Lamlyn"
188,"Summon forth your skyslipper, the greatest mechanical marvel to ever resemble a shoe.","Once belonging to the imperial family, this unique craft was abandoned in a grotto by its owners due to a malfunction. It was later retrieved via airship and stored in the Crystal Tower, where it lay until its recent rediscovery and restoration
by artisans of the
Crystalline Mean.","Ready to take us wherever
we need to go, aye. Back again
too, maybe, if we ask it nicely.
   - Thancred"
189,"Summon forth your fae gwiber, a draconic arcane entity.","Desiring to recreate the fantastical beast known as the dragon, a sorcerer from ages past fashioned a horn imbued with Titania's power. The creature which answers the sound is aglow with fae magicks.","Come to hear about
dragon legends, yes, yes?
   - Gyodo"
190,"Summon forth your triceratops seemingly from a page right out of prehistory.","In defiance of its bulk, this prehistoric horned beast has been rendered capable of flight courtesy of its saddle. Employing Ronkan ingenuity, the singular contraption was modified from an artifact discovered within ancient ruins by the moogle Nutsy,
fearless leader of the clan
of his namesake.","Can you please go and steal
a dinosaur egg for us?
   - Vath Braveheart"
191,"Summon forth your ironfrog mover, a dwarf-made automaton.","Dwarven artisans have reinforced this automaton to improve lower body durability as well as installed a propulsion unit to enable flight. The techniques employed in its creation are a jealously guarded secret, and a blight upon the beards
of they who betray it.","Lali-ho!
   - Every single dwarf"
192,"Summon forth your innocent gwiber, a draconic arcane entity.","Answering to a horn imbued with the almighty Innocence's power, this draconic arcane entity is enveloped in the selfsame glow as the Lightwarden whence it takes its name. Rest assured it is not a sin eater.","It would not do for an
unadorned winged lizard
to be the protagonist.
   - Alberic"
193,"Summon forth your magicked bed, and dream a little dream of never needing to get up.","Once upon a time, in the Kingdom of Voeburt, there lived a member of the royal family slothful of body but quick of mind. This man desired naught more than to never be parted from his pillow, and so commissioned a bed that could fly...only to swiftly
take to the sky without paying for it.
He, presumably, lived happily ever after.","Do not your mortal bodies tire?
Far better to dwell in dream.
   - Sri Lakshmi"
194,"Summon forth your Circus ahriman, a voidsent bred by the Continental Circus.","Raised in hopes that its Dread Gaze would reap a bountiful harvest of terror, this ahriman proved a disappointment. It has since found a new calling as an adventurer's trusty mount.","You have the eye of
an ahriman, Yda.
   - Y'shtola"
195,"Summon forth the sunspun cumulus. It is unclear whether its previous owner was a boy with a tail or simply a monkey.","There is but one man in all of Hydaelyn who can create such a mystical masterpiece, and it is said he resides upon a misty peak hidden within the mountain ranges of Doma. Crafted by stitching together dozens of smaller clouds dyed golden by the sun,
this cumulus is said to bring
good fortune to its rider.","If you live with your head

you'll find yourself on your rear.

197,"Summon forth your battle tiger, now with 100% more sharp things with which to terrorize your foes.","In the region of Bozja in Ilsabard, the sabertooth tiger has long been employed in warfare as part of infantry.

look hungry!

200,"Summon forth your morbol. Strong vines, soft heart...middling stench.","Though all it has ever wanted is to help, this morbol was found to be “too sweet” to present a challenge at the Celestium, and was transferred to the Blue Mages' Guild before it had even seen its first match─only for it to be deemed “insufficiently vile” there as well.","A morbol!? And things
were going so well...
   - Papalymo"
201,"Summon forth your portly porxie. Bears you places to the tantalizing smell of cured meats.","A prodigious porxie created by the Nu Mou Lugg Aenc for transportation purposes. Fond of sausages, it oft spends its free time in the curing chamber, and thus has come to take on the aroma. While comfortable to
ride thanks to its soft curves,
expect regular rumblings
from its belly.","Oooh, when I get my hands
on those porxienappers...
   - Uin Nee"
202,"Summon forth Epimetheus, an unstoppable vehicle of war. Or at least it would be if it were bigger.","Garlond Ironworks recreated this warmachina from a blueprint acquired by a Scion operative on a covert mission to Garlemald. As the dimensions were missing from the document, however, its size had to be estimated, the resultant vehicle being rather smaller than the original.","I never dreamed that I would
have the chance to see such a
ferocious warmachina with my
own eyes!
   - Warmachina Fanatic"
203,"Summon forth Menoetius. Just like Epimetheus, but more comfortable.","Following their successful recreation of Epimetheus, Garlond Ironworks set out to refine the vehicle's design. Their efforts resulted in Menoetius, a model which retains its predecessor's speed while boasting improved comfort and manufacturability.","Of late, all I can think about is
Weapons, Weapons, Weapons.
   - Warmachina Fanatic"
204,"Summon forth your Construct VII. Rumors that it is heavily based on an Ivalician design are entirely unfounded. Well, almost.","Having taken prisoner what they thought was an automaton during a skirmish with the kobolds, Maelstrom officers were shocked to find that it was instead a type of synthetic golem─but not so shocked as to not immediately bring it to Naldiq & Vymelli's for repair and later sale.","So the kobolds are at it again...
   - Anaoc"
205,"Summon forth your shadow gwiber, a draconic arcane entity.","Answering to a horn imbued with the power of a sorcerer of eld, this draconic arcane entity is believed to have been created by Emet-Selch on a whim─an act that would have barely taxed his powers as an ancient.","Are you some kind of
lesser dragon, kupo?
   - Mogzin"
206,"Summon forth your spriggan stonecarrier. Lives to carry ore, eggs, and you.","Grown to a prodigious size by virtue of its appetite, this spriggan was choking on a chunk of ore when it was found and saved by a band of miners. Seeking to repay the kindness of men, it took to carrying their burdens, which apparently
includes men themselves.","It must be so tiring living
each day carrying around
a brain of solid stone.
   - Da Za"
207,"Summon forth your forgiven reticence. The strong and silent type, so don't expect rousing conversation.","Alerted to its presence in the basement of Eulmore, the hunters of Clan Nutsy set out to vanquish this sin eater. Upon seeing that the creature was not aggressive, however, they decided to keep it instead.","Pray excuse our reticence.
   - Lucia"
208,"Summon forth your dhalmel, a towering herbivore native to the Sea of Clouds.","While attempting to nibble at a tree on a nearby isle, this dhalmel lost its footing and fell. As it plunged towards certain death, the fervent desire to live awakened its latent ability to harness the wind, and thus did it soar to safety.
This may or may not have
happened, but let's say it did.","You've never <Emphasis>seen</Emphasis>
a dhalmel before!?
   - Atelloune"
209,"Summon forth your albino karakul, a black sheep among its kind. Which is to say it's white.","Though karakuls ordinarily have black fleece, this creature raised in the paddocks of House Haillenarte was born snowy white. This rarest of qualities spared it a fate at the dining table, and it grew to such a size as to be able to bear people
upon its fluffy back.","A wise knight keeps her
own source of wool.

214,"Summon forth your kingly peacock, an avian embodiment of nobility hailing from Othard.","From the Near East to the Far, the peacock has long been esteemed not only for its beauty, but also its penchant for eating harmful vilekin. This particular creature belongs to a breed created by improving a species indigenous to
Othard with geomancy.","Don't you be taken in
by his peacockin'.
   - Rowena"
215,"Summon forth the Great Vessel of Ronka. Don't mind the contents.","This ancient Ronkan urn was discovered empty save for a peculiar flute, the sound of which caused the vessel to suddenly become thus occupied. “Where did it come from?” the curious may be compelled to inquire, but the wise know better
than to question the divine.","The great serpent
has spoken!
   - Quinfort"
216,"Summon forth your pteranodon, a winged scalekin that has existed since ancient times.","In the course of feeding upon food scraps discarded at the <Emphasis>Bounty</Emphasis>, this creature grew so familiar with men as to allow riders upon its back.

217,"Summon forth your ruby gwiber, a draconic arcane entity.","Believed to have been absorbed into the Ruby Weapon, this plate-clad being answers the call of a horn imbued with the power of an unknown primal.

Sharks spilling from the sky in a
spectacular shower of scales?
   - Sisipu"
219,"Summon forth Ramuh. No, not that one. The one you fought in the Empty. But not the actual one.","It is believed that Shiva's summoning in the Empty caused lightning-aspected aether left over from your battle with Ramuh to coalesce. The resultant crystal, when imbued with magic, gives rise to an entity which assumes the form of
the Lord of Levin in all of his
horse-legged, hulking glory.","Now nature sends thunder
and lightning against us!
   - Sylphie"
220,"Summon forth your Rubellite Carbuncle, an arcane entity given form by the mysteries of rubellite geometry.","Those adventurers who have longed to hop on their Carbuncles' backs can give thanks to the arcanist Ulan, whose research into Diamond Carbuncle provided the necessary cues to create an arcane entity of ridable proportions. As its form is maintained by a large rubellite, it can be summoned even by those unversed in the ways of arcanima.","Betrayed by my own
carbuncle yet again...

authorities.","We get to ride a horsebird
carriage? I don't know...
It sounds scary.
