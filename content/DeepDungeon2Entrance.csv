You may enter Heaven–on–High solo or in a party of up to four players. When speaking with Kyusei, you will be given the option to enter with a fixed party or a matched party via the matching system.
To create a fixed party, the party leader must speak with Kyusei after forming a party of up to four players. Please note that all party members must have at least one unused save slot.
You must be a Disciple of War or Magic of level 61 or above to participate."

Players who enter from floor 1 will start at level 61 regardless of their current class or job level. When resuming forays into the tower, players will start at the level attained when their progress was last saved.
Players who enter from floor 21, however, will start at level 70."

It is possible to receive a score for your performance in Heaven–on–High. In order to do so, you must enter with a fixed party.

A fixed party is also required to challenge floor 31 and beyond. Moreover, your Party KO count must be zero in order to enter. Please note that the Party KO count will also increase in the event your party abandons the duty."

Your level will be reset to 61 if resetting to floor 1 and level 70 if resetting to floor 21.

It is possible to convert fixed party save data to matched party save data, allowing you to be matched automatically with other players via the matching system. Please note that all special items (pomanders) will be lost upon converting your data.
Once saved data from a fixed party is converted, it can only be used when selecting matched party. It cannot be restored to its original state."

Although players can no longer enter as a fixed party after converting their saved data, it is still possible to create preformed parties as long as the party is formed before entering Heaven–on–High. The progression of all party members must be identical when doing so. Any open party slots will be filled automatically via the matching system.
Please note that a matched party cannot be used to challenge floors beyond floor 30."

Players must use empyrean aetherpool armor and arms in place of normal gear when inside Heaven–on–High. They will be equipped automatically upon entering, and can then be strengthened as you progress through the dungeon."

Empyrean aetherpool gear can be enhanced by accessing silver coffers. These coffers are found randomly on each floor and after defeating certain enemies.
The maximum strength of empyrean aetherpool gear may be restricted depending on your class or job level and current progression in the tower. This can be confirmed when viewing the Character Info window."

Under certain circumstances, you may be unable to join a matched party due to insufficient gear strength. In such cases, it may be necessary to resume your exploration of Heaven–on–High from floor 1 to ensure your empyrean aetherpool gear is of sufficient strength."

Players will, on occasion, obtain pomanders from treasure coffers in Heaven–on–High. These items can be used by all party members once acquired.
