42,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_02400_100250_ILBERD","Well, it would seem your services were not required after all. I daresay we have Raubahn's prudence to thank for that. Still, I was glad of your presence. My thanks, Scion."

54,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_02400_300130_ALPHINAUD","What is more, we have yet to achieve a lasting victory over the primal menace. The beast tribes continue to summon their gods, and each incarnation is stronger than the last."

57,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_02400_300160_ALPHINAUD","On what grounds?"
58,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_02400_300170_AYMERIC","Despite their presence in Coerthas, the Ixal do not concern us. Their territorial claims pertain to Gridanian lands, and it is the people of Gridania whom they harry."

60,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_02400_300190_AYMERIC","Even were that not the case, our forces are wholly committed to the Dravanian conflict. We have not the knights to spare."
61,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_02400_300200_AYMERIC","As for the Garleans, we are not ignorant of history. We have observed the rise and expansion of the Empire, and we agree that it is only a matter of time before they resume their campaign in Eorzea."
62,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_02400_300220_ALPHINAUD","Then surely it would be in our best interests to present a united front?"
