We are certainly not in Eorzea anymore."

Now, if you'll excuse me, it's time to do what I do best!"

5,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000060_HANCOCK","Ah, yes, of course! Forgive me. Hancock, of the East Aldenard Trading Company, at your service. On behalf of Chairman Lolorito, I bid you welcome to Kugane, and invite you to take refreshments at our local offices."
6,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000070_ALPHINAUD","Lolorito? I was aware his interests extended beyond the borders of Eorzea, but not so far as Kugane."

9,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000091_HANCOCK","I do hope that business with the Crystal Braves did not rob you of all faith in your fellow man. Or do you really think the chairman is plotting to drag you into another one of his grand schemes?"
10,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000100_ALPHINAUD","I beg your pardon!?
If you are trying to win my trust, you are failing quite spectacularly."

12,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000111_HANCOCK","Once again, I must apologize. Too much time in the Far East, you see. One is compelled to talk in circles around everything here, and one finds oneself longing for the invigoratingly candid speech of the Ul'dahn markets...though I see now that this was neither the time nor the place to indulge said longing."
13,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000120_HANCOCK","...Might I suggest that we continue this conversation at the company offices? Too many eyes and ears here, you understand. 'Twould be decidedly reckless to say any more."
14,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000130_ALPHINAUD","If I may favor you with the invigorating candor you apparently crave─it would be decidedly reckless to follow a man I neither know nor trust. Give me one good reason why we should accept Lord Lolorito's invitation."
15,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000140_HANCOCK","Now, there's the young diplomat I was told to expect! Very well, then,
I shall explain. You understand that you are come to a most reclusive and secretive nation, yes? One whose borders are closed to foreign trade save at this single port?"
16,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000150_HANCOCK","Then it should come as no surprise that a great many parties have vested interests here. Merchants like myself are a given, of course, but for every one of us, you may be certain there is also an agent of a foreign government."
17,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000160_HANCOCK","Many notable nations and empires have embassies here, you know─including, of course, the Garlean Empire, with whom you have such a...difficult relationship."
18,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000170_ALISAIE","To paraphrase, Kugane is teeming with imperial spies, one or several of whom could now be listening to our every word."
19,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000180_HANCOCK","Something to that effect, yes. Beneath this veneer of bustling trade, a war for supremacy is being waged between world powers. One might say we were standing on the front lines...just not in public."
20,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000190_ALISAIE","I still have my doubts, but he may have a point.
I say we accept his invitation─for now."

Come and go as you like, and know that you may speak freely here."

24,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000230_HANCOCK","A legitimate concern. Allow me to clarify, then: the chairman bids you consider this as an expression of his heartfelt contrition for the bloody banquet and the unpleasantness which followed."
25,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000240_HANCOCK","Never having been one to put stock in words alone, the chairman deems the provision of material aid to be a more appropriate demonstration of his sincerity."
26,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000250_HANCOCK","By sheer coincidence, your purpose here also happens to coincide with our own interests. That is, assuming you are come to aid the Doman Liberation Front?"
27,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000260_ALPHINAUD","How could─ ...Hm. I will not bother to offer a denial. Aye, you have the right of it. To be specific, we are come in search of our Far Eastern allies, Yugiri and Gosetsu, whom we hope to assist in their fight."

29,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000280_LYSE","Are you sure?"
30,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000290_HANCOCK","Quite. They came here aboard a company vessel, you see. However, they encountered difficulties securing passage across the Ruby Sea."
31,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000300_LYSE","The Ruby Sea? Sorry, I've never been any good at geography."
32,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000310_HANCOCK","Forgive me. This calls for a map."

35,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000340_HANCOCK","Therefore, if your friends are to reach Doma, they must first cross the Ruby Sea."
36,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000350_HANCOCK","Alas, this is easier said than done as the Ruby Sea does not fall within the dominion of either Hingashi or Doma, being controlled since antiquity by a third party: namely, the Confederacy."
37,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000360_HANCOCK","Said maritime collective is known for the consummate skill of its sailors...and for demanding that any vessel entering its waters pay a toll referred to as the “Ruby Tithe.” In exchange, the Confederacy's vast fleet “guarantees the safety” of those who travel within its territory."
38,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000370_HANCOCK","Now, as I am sure you are aware, Garlemald conquered Doma some twenty-five years past, at which time the Empire saw no value in controlling the Ruby Sea. And thus did they turn a blind eye to the activities of the Confederacy."
39,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000380_HANCOCK","The recently appointed acting imperial viceroy of Doma had other ideas, however. She has formally condemned the Confederacy and declared that any who recognize their authority shall be branded enemies of the Empire."
40,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000390_HANCOCK","Bowing to this pressure, Hingashi severed ties with these toll-takers and forbade the payment of the Ruby Tithe, prompting the Confederacy to make
it known that any merchants choosing to sail the Ruby Sea would do so
at their peril..."
41,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000400_ALISAIE","No wonder they struggled to secure passage to Doma. What captain would risk such a journey given the circumstances?"

Long before was it pledged to another."

I should think."

I know a safer way."

65,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_04001_000640_LYSE","Our meeting went about as well as expected. We've brought the Namazu who thought to betray us. When he wakes up, we'll see what he knows about Yugiri and Gosetsu."

Kojin of the Red may serve the Empire as mercenaries, but Kojin of the Blue walk a different path."

Namely, the East Aldenard Trading Company."

Allow me to explain..."
