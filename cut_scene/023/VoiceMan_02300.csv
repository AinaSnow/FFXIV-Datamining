146,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_02300_B00100_URIANGER","The significance of Y'shtola's readings might better be understood in the context of mine own, taken at the instant of the Lord of Levin's demise. Unlike the primal, the Sahagin was not subject to aetheric dissipation."
147,"TEXT_VOICEMAN_02300_B00110_MINFILIA","Before discussing our new discoveries, it may benefit us all to recall what we know of aetheric behavior."

In order to manifest and then maintain a physical presence in this realm, they must consume vast quantities of aether, most often in the form of crystals. Though they may seem to live, their flesh is but aether given shape."
